# Welcome to the Semantic Kernel Community!

Below are some ways that you can get involved in the SK Community.

## Engage on Github

- [Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/discussions): Ask questions, provide feedback and ideas to what you'd like to see from the Semantic Kernel.
- [Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/issues) - If you find a bug, unexpected behavior or have a feature request, please open an issue.
- [Pull Requests](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/pulls) - We welcome contributions! Please see our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

We do our best to respond to each submission.

## Public Community Office Hours

We regularly have Community Office Hours that are open to the **public** to join.

Add Semantic Kernel events to your calendar - we're running two community calls to cater different timezones for Q&A Office Hours:

- Americas timezone: download the [calendar.ics](https://aka.ms/sk-community-calendar) file.
- Asia Pacific timezone: download the [calendar-APAC.ics](https://aka.ms/sk-community-calendar-apac) file.

If you have any questions or if you would like to showcase your project(s), please email what you'd like us to cover here: skofficehours[at]microsoft.com.

If you are unable to make it live, all meetings will be recorded and posted online.

## Engage on our Community Discord

This is a great place to ask questions, share your projects, and get help from the community.
