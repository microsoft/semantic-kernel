## Public Community Office Hours

We regularly have Community Office Hours that are open to the **public** to join.

Add Semantic Kernel events to your calendar. We are running two community calls to accommodate different time zones for Q&A Office Hours:

- **Americas & EMEA timezone:** Every Wednesday at 8:00 AM Pacific Time/17:00 CET. Adjusted for daylight savings. Join here: [SK-Americas-Europe-OfficeHours](https://aka.ms/sk-officehours).
- **Asia Pacific timezone:** The second Wednesday of every month at 4:00 PM Pacific Time Wednesday. In much of Asia this occurs on Thursday local time. Adjusted for daylight savings. Join here: [SK-APAC-OfficeHours](https://aka.ms/sk-apac-officehours).

If you have any questions or if you would like to showcase your project(s), please email what you'd like us to cover here: skofficehours[at]microsoft.com.

If you are unable to make it live, all meetings will be recorded and posted online.
