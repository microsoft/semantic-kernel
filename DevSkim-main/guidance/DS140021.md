# Banned C function detected (strlen)

## Summary

* Use of the `strlen` function to determine the length of a string can lead to a buffer overrun vulnerability.
* Use secure versions such as `strlen_s` or `strnlen` to help prevent buffer overruns.

## Details

The `strlen` function counts characters until the null terminator is encountered.
When a string is missing the null terminator, the resulting value returned is larger than the string.
Code that relies on the result of `strlen` can suffer from a buffer overrun vulnerability.

## Solution

Use secure versions such as `strlen_s` or `strnlen` to help prevent buffer overruns. See [Microsoft C Runtime Reference: strnlen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/strnlen-strnlen-s) for more information.

## Severity Considerations

In the worst case, a buffer overrun vulnerability can provide an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code leading to complete system compromise.
