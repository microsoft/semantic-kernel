schedule:
  api_field: job.schedule
  arg_name: schedule
  help_text: |
    Schedule on which the job will be executed.

    As a general rule, execution `n + 1` of a job will not begin until
    execution `n` has finished. Cloud Scheduler will never allow two
    simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that if
    the `n+1` execution is scheduled to run at `16:00` but the `n`
    execution takes until `16:15`, the `n+1` execution will not start
    until `16:15`. A scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous
    execution has not ended when its scheduled time occurs.

    If --retry-count > 0 and a job attempt fails, the job will be tried a
    total of --retry-count times, with exponential backoff, until the next
    scheduled start time.

    The schedule can be either of the following types:
    * Crontab: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview
    * English-like schedule: https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/quickstart#defining_the_job_schedule

timezone: &timezone

    Specifies the time zone to be used in interpreting --schedule. The value

    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

    Note that some time zones include a provision for
    daylight savings time. The rules for daylight saving time are
    determined by the chosen time zone.

    For UTC use the string "utc". Default is "utc".
