    error: The error result of the operation in case of failure or
      cancellation.
    metadata: Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It
      typically contains progress information and common metadata such as
      create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method
      that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type,
      if any.
    name: The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same
      service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping,
      the `name` should be a resource name ending with
      `operations/{unique_id}`.
    response: The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the
      original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the
      response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard
      `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other
      methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is
      the original method name. For example, if the original method name is
      `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

class ApigatewayPolicy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of
  Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is
  a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
  evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
  the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support
  conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: -
  user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com -
  serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:
  roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable

  version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
