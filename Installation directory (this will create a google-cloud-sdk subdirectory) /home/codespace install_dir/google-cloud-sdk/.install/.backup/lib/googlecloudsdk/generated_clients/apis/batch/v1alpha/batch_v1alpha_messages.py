      the [`image-streaming` sample on
      GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/batch-
      samples/tree/main/api-samples/image-streaming).
    entrypoint: Overrides the `ENTRYPOINT` specified in the container.
    imageUri: The URI to pull the container image from.
    options: Arbitrary additional options to include in the "docker run"
      command when running this container, e.g. "--network host".
    password: Required if the container image is from a private Docker
      registry. The password to login to the Docker registry that contains the
      image. For security, it is strongly recommended to specify an encrypted
      password by using a Secret Manager secret:
      `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. Warning: If you specify the password
      using plain text, you risk the password being exposed to any users who
      can view the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret that
      contains the password instead. Learn more about [Secret
      Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/) and [using
      Secret Manager with Batch](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/create-
      run-job-secret-manager).
    username: Required if the container image is from a private Docker
      registry. The username to login to the Docker registry that contains the
      image. You can either specify the username directly by using plain text
      or specify an encrypted username by using a Secret Manager secret:
      `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. However, using a secret is
      recommended for enhanced security. Caution: If you specify the username
      using plain text, you risk the username being exposed to any users who
      can view the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret that
      contains the username instead. Learn more about [Secret
      Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/) and [using
      Secret Manager with Batch](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/create-
      run-job-secret-manager).
    volumes: Volumes to mount (bind mount) from the host machine files or
      directories into the container, formatted to match docker run's --volume
      option, e.g. /foo:/bar, or /foo:/bar:ro If the `TaskSpec.Volumes` field
      is specified but this field is not, Batch will mount each volume from
      the host machine to the container with the same mount path by default.
      In this case, the default mount option for containers will be read-only
      (ro) for existing persistent disks and read-write (rw) for other volume
      types, regardless of the original mount options specified in
      `TaskSpec.Volumes`. If you need different mount settings, you can
      explicitly configure them in this field.

  Fields:
    diskInterface: Local SSDs are available through both "SCSI" and "NVMe"
      interfaces. If not indicated, "NVMe" will be the default one for local
      ssds. This field is ignored for persistent disks as the interface is
      chosen automatically. See
      https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/persistent-
      disks#choose_an_interface.
    image: URL for a VM image to use as the data source for this disk. For
      example, the following are all valid URLs: * Specify the image by its
      family name: projects/{project}/global/images/family/{image_family} *
      Specify the image version:
      projects/{project}/global/images/{image_version} You can also use Batch
      customized image in short names. The following image values are
      supported for a boot disk: * `batch-debian`: use Batch Debian images. *
      `batch-centos`: use Batch CentOS images. * `batch-cos`: use Batch
      Container-Optimized images. * `batch-hpc-centos`: use Batch HPC CentOS
      images. * `batch-hpc-rocky`: use Batch HPC Rocky Linux images.
    sizeGb: Disk size in GB. **Non-Boot Disk**: If the `type` specifies a
      persistent disk, this field is ignored if `data_source` is set as
      `image` or `snapshot`. If the `type` specifies a local SSD, this field
      should be a multiple of 375 GB, otherwise, the final size will be the
      next greater multiple of 375 GB. **Boot Disk**: Batch will calculate the
      boot disk size based on source image and task requirements if you do not
      speicify the size. If both this field and the `boot_disk_mib` field in
      task spec's `compute_resource` are defined, Batch will only honor this
      field. Also, this field should be no smaller than the source disk's size
      when the `data_source` is set as `snapshot` or `image`. For example, if
      you set an image as the `data_source` field and the image's default disk
      size 30 GB, you can only use this field to make the disk larger or equal
      to 30 GB.
    snapshot: Name of a snapshot used as the data source. Snapshot is not
      supported as boot disk now.
    type: Disk type as shown in `gcloud compute disk-types list`. For example,
      local SSD uses type "local-ssd". Persistent disks and boot disks use
      "pd-balanced", "pd-extreme", "pd-ssd" or "pd-standard".
