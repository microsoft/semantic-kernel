  calculated globally by counting the total number of correctly predicted
  rows.

  Fields:
    accuracy: Accuracy is the fraction of predictions given the correct label.

    logLoss: Logarithmic Loss. For multiclass this is a macro-averaged metric.
    precision: Precision is the fraction of actual positive predictions that
      had positive actual labels. For multiclass this is a macro-averaged
      metric treating each class as a binary classifier.
    recall: Recall is the fraction of actual positive labels that were given a
      positive prediction. For multiclass this is a macro-averaged metric.
    rocAuc: Area Under a ROC Curve. For multiclass this is a macro-averaged

      values are UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, and
      UTF-32LE. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after
      the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and
      fieldDelimiter properties.
    fieldDelimiter: Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV
      file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded
      in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For
      files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127

      encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the
      first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be
      treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape
      sequence "\t" (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is
      comma (",", U+002C).
    nullMarker: [Optional] A custom string that will represent a NULL value in
      CSV import data.
    preserveAsciiControlCharacters: Optional. Indicates if the embedded ASCII
      control characters (the first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from
      '\x00' to '\x1F') are preserved.
    quote: Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV
      file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses
      the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw,
      binary state. The default value is a double-quote ("). If your data does
      not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string.
      If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the
      allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote
      character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching
      quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default
      character ' " ', use ' "" '.
    skipLeadingRows: Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file
      that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0.
      This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should

      skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not

    AccessValueListEntry: An object that defines dataset access for an entity.
    LabelsValue: The labels associated with this dataset. You can use these to
      organize and group your datasets. You can set this property when

      Labels for more information.
    TagsValueListEntry: A global tag managed by Resource Manager.
      https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/tags-access-control#definitions

  Fields:
    access: Optional. An array of objects that define dataset access for one
      or more entities. You can set this property when inserting or updating a
      dataset in order to control who is allowed to access the data. If
      unspecified at dataset creation time, BigQuery adds default dataset
      access for the following entities: access.specialGroup: projectReaders;
      access.role: READER; access.specialGroup: projectWriters; access.role:
      WRITER; access.specialGroup: projectOwners; access.role: OWNER;
      access.userByEmail: [dataset creator email]; access.role: OWNER;
    creationTime: Output only. The time when this dataset was created, in
      milliseconds since the epoch.
    datasetReference: Required. A reference that identifies the dataset.
    defaultCollation: Optional. Defines the default collation specification of
      future tables created in the dataset. If a table is created in this
      dataset without table-level default collation, then the table inherits
      the dataset default collation, which is applied to the string fields
      that do not have explicit collation specified. A change to this field
      affects only tables created afterwards, and does not alter the existing
      tables. The following values are supported: * 'und:ci': undetermined
      locale, case insensitive. * '': empty string. Default to case-sensitive
      behavior.
    defaultEncryptionConfiguration: The default encryption key for all tables
      in the dataset. Once this property is set, all newly-created partitioned
      tables in the dataset will have encryption key set to this value, unless
      table creation request (or query) overrides the key.
    defaultPartitionExpirationMs: This default partition expiration, expressed
      in milliseconds. When new time-partitioned tables are created in a
      dataset where this property is set, the table will inherit this value,
      propagated as the `TimePartitioning.expirationMs` property on the new
      table. If you set `TimePartitioning.expirationMs` explicitly when
      creating a table, the `defaultPartitionExpirationMs` of the containing
      dataset is ignored. When creating a partitioned table, if
      `defaultPartitionExpirationMs` is set, the `defaultTableExpirationMs`
      value is ignored and the table will not be inherit a table expiration
      deadline.
    defaultRoundingMode: Optional. Defines the default rounding mode
      specification of new tables created within this dataset. During table
      creation, if this field is specified, the table within this dataset will
      inherit the default rounding mode of the dataset. Setting the default
      rounding mode on a table overrides this option. Existing tables in the
      dataset are unaffected. If columns are defined during that table
      creation, they will immediately inherit the table's default rounding
      mode, unless otherwise specified.
    defaultTableExpirationMs: Optional. The default lifetime of all tables in
      the dataset, in milliseconds. The minimum lifetime value is 3600000
      milliseconds (one hour). To clear an existing default expiration with a
      PATCH request, set to 0. Once this property is set, all newly-created
      tables in the dataset will have an expirationTime property set to the
      creation time plus the value in this property, and changing the value
      will only affect new tables, not existing ones. When the expirationTime
      for a given table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically.
      If a table's expirationTime is modified or removed before the table
      expires, or if you provide an explicit expirationTime when creating a
      table, that value takes precedence over the default expiration time
      indicated by this property.
    description: Optional. A user-friendly description of the dataset.
    etag: Output only. A hash of the resource.
    externalCatalogDatasetOptions: Optional. Options defining open source
      compatible datasets living in the BigQuery catalog. Contains metadata of
      open source database, schema or namespace represented by the current
      dataset.
    externalDatasetReference: Optional. Reference to a read-only external
      dataset defined in data catalogs outside of BigQuery. Filled out when
      the dataset type is EXTERNAL.
    friendlyName: Optional. A descriptive name for the dataset.
    id: Output only. The fully-qualified unique name of the dataset in the
      format projectId:datasetId. The dataset name without the project name is
      given in the datasetId field. When creating a new dataset, leave this
      field blank, and instead specify the datasetId field.
    isCaseInsensitive: Optional. TRUE if the dataset and its table names are
      case-insensitive, otherwise FALSE. By default, this is FALSE, which
      means the dataset and its table names are case-sensitive. This field
      does not affect routine references.
    kind: Output only. The resource type.
    labels: The labels associated with this dataset. You can use these to
      organize and group your datasets. You can set this property when
      inserting or updating a dataset. See Creating and Updating Dataset
      Labels for more information.
    lastModifiedTime: Output only. The date when this dataset was last
      modified, in milliseconds since the epoch.
    linkedDatasetMetadata: Output only. Metadata about the LinkedDataset.
      Filled out when the dataset type is LINKED.
    linkedDatasetSource: Optional. The source dataset reference when the
      dataset is of type LINKED. For all other dataset types it is not set.
      This field cannot be updated once it is set. Any attempt to update this
      field using Update and Patch API Operations will be ignored.
    location: The geographic location where the dataset should reside. See
      https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations for supported
      locations.
    maxTimeTravelHours: Optional. Defines the time travel window in hours. The
      value can be from 48 to 168 hours (2 to 7 days). The default value is
      168 hours if this is not set.
    satisfiesPzi: Output only. Reserved for future use.
    satisfiesPzs: Output only. Reserved for future use.
    selfLink: Output only. A URL that can be used to access the resource
      again. You can use this URL in Get or Update requests to the resource.
    storageBillingModel: Optional. Updates storage_billing_model for the
      dataset.
    tags: Output only. Tags for the Dataset.
    type: Output only. Same as `type` in `ListFormatDataset`. The type of the
      dataset, one of: * DEFAULT - only accessible by owner and authorized
      accounts, * PUBLIC - accessible by everyone, * LINKED - linked dataset,
      * EXTERNAL - dataset with definition in external metadata catalog. --

      URIs are expanded against the underlying storage. Other options include
      specifying manifest files. Only applicable to object storage systems.
    JsonExtensionValueValuesEnum: Optional. Load option to be used together
      with source_format newline-delimited JSON to indicate that a variant of
      JSON is being loaded. To load newline-delimited GeoJSON, specify GEOJSON

      table. Set this to enable caching of metadata from external data source.
    ObjectMetadataValueValuesEnum: Optional. ObjectMetadata is used to create
      Object Tables. Object Tables contain a listing of objects (with their

  Fields:
    autodetect: Try to detect schema and format options automatically. Any
      option specified explicitly will be honored.
    avroOptions: Optional. Additional properties to set if sourceFormat is set

    bigtableOptions: Optional. Additional options if sourceFormat is set to
      BIGTABLE.
    compression: Optional. The compression type of the data source. Possible
      values include GZIP and NONE. The default value is NONE. This setting is
      ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups, Avro,
      ORC and Parquet formats. An empty string is an invalid value.
    connectionId: Optional. The connection specifying the credentials to be

      The connection_id can have the form
      "<project\_id>.<location\_id>.<connection\_id>" or "projects/<project\_i
      d>/locations/<location\_id>/connections/<connection\_id>".
    csvOptions: Optional. Additional properties to set if sourceFormat is set

    decimalTargetTypes: Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which
      the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and
      the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In
      the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is
      in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale.
      STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed
      types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the
      widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the
      supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example:
      Suppose the value of this field is ["NUMERIC", "BIGNUMERIC"]. If
      (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -> NUMERIC; * (39,9) -> BIGNUMERIC
      (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -> BIGNUMERIC
      (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -> BIGNUMERIC; *
      (77,38) -> BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This
      field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this
      field is ignored. For example, ["BIGNUMERIC", "NUMERIC"] is the same as
      ["NUMERIC", "BIGNUMERIC"] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over
      BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to ["NUMERIC", "STRING"] for ORC and ["NUMERIC"]
      for the other file formats.
    fileSetSpecType: Optional. Specifies how source URIs are interpreted for
      constructing the file set to load. By default source URIs are expanded
      against the underlying storage. Other options include specifying
      manifest files. Only applicable to object storage systems.
    googleSheetsOptions: Optional. Additional options if sourceFormat is set
      to GOOGLE_SHEETS.
    hivePartitioningOptions: Optional. When set, configures hive partitioning
      support. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning -- requesting
      hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error, as
      will providing an invalid specification.
    ignoreUnknownValues: Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra
      values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra
      values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as
      bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is
      returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat
      property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV:
      Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don't match any column names
      Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore
      backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored. ORC:
      This setting is ignored. Parquet: This setting is ignored.
    jsonExtension: Optional. Load option to be used together with
      source_format newline-delimited JSON to indicate that a variant of JSON
      is being loaded. To load newline-delimited GeoJSON, specify GEOJSON (and
      source_format must be set to NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON).
    jsonOptions: Optional. Additional properties to set if sourceFormat is set
      to JSON.
    maxBadRecords: Optional. The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery
      can ignore when reading data. If the number of bad records exceeds this
      value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value
      is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This setting is ignored
      for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups, Avro, ORC and
      Parquet formats.
    metadataCacheMode: Optional. Metadata Cache Mode for the table. Set this
      to enable caching of metadata from external data source.
    objectMetadata: Optional. ObjectMetadata is used to create Object Tables.
      Object Tables contain a listing of objects (with their metadata) found
      at the source_uris. If ObjectMetadata is set, source_format should be
      omitted. Currently SIMPLE is the only supported Object Metadata type.
    parquetOptions: Optional. Additional properties to set if sourceFormat is

      user can provide a reference file with the table schema. This is enabled
      for the following formats: AVRO, PARQUET, ORC.
    schema: Optional. The schema for the data. Schema is required for CSV and
      JSON formats if autodetect is not on. Schema is disallowed for Google
      Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Datastore backups, Avro, ORC and Parquet formats.
    sourceFormat: [Required] The data format. For CSV files, specify "CSV".

    sourceUris: [Required] The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in
      Google Cloud. For Google Cloud Storage URIs: Each URI can contain one
      '*' wildcard character and it must come after the 'bucket' name. Size
      limits related to load jobs apply to external data sources. For Google
      Cloud Bigtable URIs: Exactly one URI can be specified and it has be a

      The types of the partition keys can be deduced by checking the table
      schema (which will include the partition keys). Not every API will

      it, but Tables.List will not contain this field.
    mode: Optional. When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when
      reading data. The following modes are supported: * AUTO: automatically
      infer partition key name(s) and type(s). * STRINGS: automatically infer
      partition key name(s). All types are strings. * CUSTOM: partition key
      schema is encoded in the source URI prefix. Not all storage formats
      support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an
      unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported formats
      are: JSON, CSV, ORC, Avro and Parquet.
    requirePartitionFilter: Optional. If set to true, queries over this table
      require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to
      be specified. Note that this field should only be true when creating a
      permanent external table or querying a temporary external table. Hive-
      partitioned loads with require_partition_filter explicitly set to true

    sourceUriPrefix: Optional. When hive partition detection is requested, a
      common prefix for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end
      immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example,
      consider files following this data layout:
      gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro
      gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When
      hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection,
      the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or
      gs://bucket/path_to_table/. CUSTOM detection requires encoding the
      partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any
      of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} *
      gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} *

class JobConfigurationLoad(_messages.Message):
  r"""JobConfigurationLoad contains the configuration properties for loading
  data into a destination table.

  Enums:
    DecimalTargetTypesValueListEntryValuesEnum:
    FileSetSpecTypeValueValuesEnum: Optional. Specifies how source URIs are
      interpreted for constructing the file set to load. By default, source
      URIs are expanded against the underlying storage. You can also specify
      manifest files to control how the file set is constructed. This option
      is only applicable to object storage systems.
    JsonExtensionValueValuesEnum: Optional. Load option to be used together
      with source_format newline-delimited JSON to indicate that a variant of
      JSON is being loaded. To load newline-delimited GeoJSON, specify GEOJSON
      (and source_format must be set to NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON).

  Fields:
    allowJaggedRows: Optional. Accept rows that are missing trailing optional
      columns. The missing values are treated as nulls. If false, records with
      missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are
      too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result.
      The default value is false. Only applicable to CSV, ignored for other
      formats.
    allowQuotedNewlines: Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data
      sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default
      value is false.
    autodetect: Optional. Indicates if we should automatically infer the
      options and schema for CSV and JSON sources.
    clustering: Clustering specification for the destination table.
    connectionProperties: Optional. Connection properties which can modify the
      load job behavior. Currently, only the 'session_id' connection property
      is supported, and is used to resolve _SESSION appearing as the dataset
      id.
    copyFilesOnly: Optional. [Experimental] Configures the load job to only
      copy files to the destination BigLake managed table with an external
      storage_uri, without reading file content and writing them to new files.
      Copying files only is supported when: * source_uris are in the same
      external storage system as the destination table but they do not overlap
      with storage_uri of the destination table. * source_format is the same
      file format as the destination table. * destination_table is an existing
      BigLake managed table. Its schema does not have default value
      expression. It schema does not have type parameters other than precision
      and scale. * No options other than the above are specified.
    createDisposition: Optional. Specifies whether the job is allowed to
      create new tables. The following values are supported: *
      CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the
      table. * CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a
      'notFound' error is returned in the job result. The default value is
      CREATE_IF_NEEDED. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one
      atomic update upon job completion.
    createSession: Optional. If this property is true, the job creates a new
      session using a randomly generated session_id. To continue using a
      created session with subsequent queries, pass the existing session
      identifier as a `ConnectionProperty` value. The session identifier is
      returned as part of the `SessionInfo` message within the query
      statistics. The new session's location will be set to
      `Job.JobReference.location` if it is present, otherwise it's set to the
      default location based on existing routing logic.
    decimalTargetTypes: Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which
      the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and
      the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In
      the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is
      in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale.
      STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed
      types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the
      widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the
      supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example:
      Suppose the value of this field is ["NUMERIC", "BIGNUMERIC"]. If
      (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -> NUMERIC; * (39,9) -> BIGNUMERIC
      (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -> BIGNUMERIC
      (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -> BIGNUMERIC; *
      (77,38) -> BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This
      field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this
      field is ignored. For example, ["BIGNUMERIC", "NUMERIC"] is the same as
      ["NUMERIC", "BIGNUMERIC"] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over
      BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to ["NUMERIC", "STRING"] for ORC and ["NUMERIC"]
      for the other file formats.
    destinationEncryptionConfiguration: Custom encryption configuration (e.g.,
      Cloud KMS keys)
    destinationTable: [Required] The destination table to load the data into.
    destinationTableProperties: Optional. [Experimental] Properties with which
      to create the destination table if it is new.
    encoding: Optional. The character encoding of the data. The supported
      values are UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, and
      UTF-32LE. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after
      the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the `quote` and
      `fieldDelimiter` properties. If you don't specify an encoding, or if you
      specify a UTF-8 encoding when the CSV file is not UTF-8 encoded,
      BigQuery attempts to convert the data to UTF-8. Generally, your data
      loads successfully, but it may not match byte-for-byte what you expect.
      To avoid this, specify the correct encoding by using the `--encoding`
      flag. If BigQuery can't convert a character other than the ASCII `0`
      character, BigQuery converts the character to the standard Unicode
      replacement character: \ufffd.
    fieldDelimiter: Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV
      file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded
      in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For
      files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127
      (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters
      encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the
      first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be
      treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape
      sequence "\t" (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is
      comma (",", U+002C).
    fileSetSpecType: Optional. Specifies how source URIs are interpreted for
      constructing the file set to load. By default, source URIs are expanded
      against the underlying storage. You can also specify manifest files to
      control how the file set is constructed. This option is only applicable
      to object storage systems.
    hivePartitioningOptions: Optional. When set, configures hive partitioning
      support. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning -- requesting
      hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error, as
      will providing an invalid specification.
    ignoreUnknownValues: Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra
      values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra
      values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as
      bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is
      returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat
      property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV:
      Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don't match any column names in
      the table schema Avro, Parquet, ORC: Fields in the file schema that
      don't exist in the table schema.
    jsonExtension: Optional. Load option to be used together with
      source_format newline-delimited JSON to indicate that a variant of JSON
      is being loaded. To load newline-delimited GeoJSON, specify GEOJSON (and
      source_format must be set to NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON).
    maxBadRecords: Optional. The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery
      can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds
      this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default
      value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This is only
      supported for CSV and NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON file formats.
    nullMarker: Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a
      CSV file. For example, if you specify "\\N", BigQuery interprets "\\N"
      as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty
      string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an
      error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING
      and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty
      string as an empty value.
    parquetOptions: Optional. Additional properties to set if sourceFormat is
      set to PARQUET.
    preserveAsciiControlCharacters: Optional. When sourceFormat is set to
      "CSV", this indicates whether the embedded ASCII control characters (the
      first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from '\x00' to '\x1F') are
      preserved.
    projectionFields: If sourceFormat is set to "DATASTORE_BACKUP", indicates
      which entity properties to load into BigQuery from a Cloud Datastore
      backup. Property names are case sensitive and must be top-level
      properties. If no properties are specified, BigQuery loads all
      properties. If any named property isn't found in the Cloud Datastore
      backup, an invalid error is returned in the job result.
    quote: Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV
      file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses
      the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw,
      binary state. The default value is a double-quote ('"'). If your data
      does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty
      string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also
      set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific
      quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional
      matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default
      character ' " ', use ' "" '. @default "
    rangePartitioning: Range partitioning specification for the destination
      table. Only one of timePartitioning and rangePartitioning should be
      specified.
    referenceFileSchemaUri: Optional. The user can provide a reference file
      with the reader schema. This file is only loaded if it is part of source
      URIs, but is not loaded otherwise. It is enabled for the following
      formats: AVRO, PARQUET, ORC.
    schema: Optional. The schema for the destination table. The schema can be
      omitted if the destination table already exists, or if you're loading
      data from Google Cloud Datastore.
    schemaInline: [Deprecated] The inline schema. For CSV schemas, specify as
      "Field1:Type1[,Field2:Type2]*". For example, "foo:STRING, bar:INTEGER,
      baz:FLOAT".
    schemaInlineFormat: [Deprecated] The format of the schemaInline property.
    schemaUpdateOptions: Allows the schema of the destination table to be
      updated as a side effect of the load job if a schema is autodetected or
      supplied in the job configuration. Schema update options are supported
      in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when
      writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a
      partition of a table, specified by partition decorators. For normal
      tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of
      the following values are specified: * ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding
      a nullable field to the schema. * ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing
      a required field in the original schema to nullable.
    skipLeadingRows: Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file
      that BigQuery will skip when loading the data. The default value is 0.
      This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should
      be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: *
      skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the
      first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise
      data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 -
      Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read
      starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect
      skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not
      detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract
      column names for the detected schema.
    sourceFormat: Optional. The format of the data files. For CSV files,
      specify "CSV". For datastore backups, specify "DATASTORE_BACKUP". For
      newline-delimited JSON, specify "NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON". For Avro,
      specify "AVRO". For parquet, specify "PARQUET". For orc, specify "ORC".
      The default value is CSV.
    sourceUris: [Required] The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in
      Google Cloud. For Google Cloud Storage URIs: Each URI can contain one
      '*' wildcard character and it must come after the 'bucket' name. Size
      limits related to load jobs apply to external data sources. For Google
      Cloud Bigtable URIs: Exactly one URI can be specified and it has be a
      fully specified and valid HTTPS URL for a Google Cloud Bigtable table.
      For Google Cloud Datastore backups: Exactly one URI can be specified.
      Also, the '*' wildcard character is not allowed.
    timePartitioning: Time-based partitioning specification for the
      destination table. Only one of timePartitioning and rangePartitioning
      should be specified.
    useAvroLogicalTypes: Optional. If sourceFormat is set to "AVRO", indicates
      whether to interpret logical types as the corresponding BigQuery data
      type (for example, TIMESTAMP), instead of using the raw type (for
      example, INTEGER).
    writeDisposition: Optional. Specifies the action that occurs if the
      destination table already exists. The following values are supported: *
      WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the
      data, removes the constraints and uses the schema from the load job. *
      WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to
      the table. * WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data,
      a 'duplicate' error is returned in the job result. The default value is
      WRITE_APPEND. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able
      to complete the job successfully. Creation, truncation and append
      actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.

  Messages:
    TableDefinitionsValue: Optional. You can specify external table
      definitions, which operate as ephemeral tables that can be queried.
      These definitions are configured using a JSON map, where the string key
      represents the table identifier, and the value is the corresponding
      external data configuration object.

  Fields:
    allowLargeResults: Optional. If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect,
      allows the query to produce arbitrarily large result tables at a slight
      cost in performance. Requires destinationTable to be set. For GoogleSQL
      queries, this flag is ignored and large results are always allowed.
      However, you must still set destinationTable when result size exceeds
      the allowed maximum response size.
    clustering: Clustering specification for the destination table.
    connectionProperties: Connection properties which can modify the query
      behavior.
    continuous: [Optional] Specifies whether the query should be executed as a
      continuous query. The default value is false.
    createDisposition: Optional. Specifies whether the job is allowed to
      create new tables. The following values are supported: *
      CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the
      table. * CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a
      'notFound' error is returned in the job result. The default value is
      CREATE_IF_NEEDED. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one
      atomic update upon job completion.
    createSession: If this property is true, the job creates a new session
      using a randomly generated session_id. To continue using a created
      session with subsequent queries, pass the existing session identifier as
      a `ConnectionProperty` value. The session identifier is returned as part

      session's location will be set to `Job.JobReference.location` if it is
      present, otherwise it's set to the default location based on existing
      routing logic.
    defaultDataset: Optional. Specifies the default dataset to use for
      unqualified table names in the query. This setting does not alter
      behavior of unqualified dataset names. Setting the system variable
      `@@dataset_id` achieves the same behavior. See
      https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/system-variables for
      more information on system variables.
    destinationEncryptionConfiguration: Custom encryption configuration (e.g.,
      Cloud KMS keys)
    destinationTable: Optional. Describes the table where the query results
      should be stored. This property must be set for large results that
      exceed the maximum response size. For queries that produce anonymous
      (cached) results, this field will be populated by BigQuery.
    flattenResults: Optional. If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect,
      flattens all nested and repeated fields in the query results.
      allowLargeResults must be true if this is set to false. For GoogleSQL
      queries, this flag is ignored and results are never flattened.
    maximumBillingTier: Optional. [Deprecated] Maximum billing tier allowed
      for this query. The billing tier controls the amount of compute
      resources allotted to the query, and multiplies the on-demand cost of
      the query accordingly. A query that runs within its allotted resources
      will succeed and indicate its billing tier in
      statistics.query.billingTier, but if the query exceeds its allotted
      resources, it will fail with billingTierLimitExceeded. WARNING: The
      billed byte amount can be multiplied by an amount up to this number!
      Most users should not need to alter this setting, and we recommend that
      you avoid introducing new uses of it.
    maximumBytesBilled: Limits the bytes billed for this job. Queries that
      will have bytes billed beyond this limit will fail (without incurring a
      charge). If unspecified, this will be set to your project default.
    parameterMode: GoogleSQL only. Set to POSITIONAL to use positional (?)
      query parameters or to NAMED to use named (@myparam) query parameters in
      this query.
    preserveNulls: [Deprecated] This property is deprecated.
    priority: Optional. Specifies a priority for the query. Possible values
      include INTERACTIVE and BATCH. The default value is INTERACTIVE.
    query: [Required] SQL query text to execute. The useLegacySql field can be
      used to indicate whether the query uses legacy SQL or GoogleSQL.
    queryParameters: Query parameters for GoogleSQL queries.
    rangePartitioning: Range partitioning specification for the destination
      table. Only one of timePartitioning and rangePartitioning should be
      specified.
    schemaUpdateOptions: Allows the schema of the destination table to be
      updated as a side effect of the query job. Schema update options are
      supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when
      writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a
      partition of a table, specified by partition decorators. For normal
      tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of
      the following values are specified: * ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding
      a nullable field to the schema. * ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing
      a required field in the original schema to nullable.
    scriptOptions: Options controlling the execution of scripts.
    systemVariables: Output only. System variables for GoogleSQL queries. A
      system variable is output if the variable is settable and its value
      differs from the system default. "@@" prefix is not included in the name
      of the System variables.
    tableDefinitions: Optional. You can specify external table definitions,
      which operate as ephemeral tables that can be queried. These definitions
      are configured using a JSON map, where the string key represents the
      table identifier, and the value is the corresponding external data
      configuration object.
    timePartitioning: Time-based partitioning specification for the
      destination table. Only one of timePartitioning and rangePartitioning
      should be specified.
    useLegacySql: Optional. Specifies whether to use BigQuery's legacy SQL
      dialect for this query. The default value is true. If set to false, the
      query will use BigQuery's GoogleSQL:
      https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/ When useLegacySql is
      set to false, the value of flattenResults is ignored; query will be run
      as if flattenResults is false.
    useQueryCache: Optional. Whether to look for the result in the query
      cache. The query cache is a best-effort cache that will be flushed
      whenever tables in the query are modified. Moreover, the query cache is
      only available when a query does not have a destination table specified.
      The default value is true.
    userDefinedFunctionResources: Describes user-defined function resources
      used in the query.
    writeDisposition: Optional. Specifies the action that occurs if the
      destination table already exists. The following values are supported: *
      WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the
      data, removes the constraints, and uses the schema from the query
      result. * WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends
      the data to the table. * WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and
      contains data, a 'duplicate' error is returned in the job result. The
      default value is WRITE_EMPTY. Each action is atomic and only occurs if
      BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Creation, truncation
      and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-

      JobCreationMode. This feature is not yet available. Jobs will always be
      created.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Optional. The labels associated with this query. Labels can
      be used to organize and group query jobs. Label keys and values can be
      no longer than 63 characters, can only contain lowercase letters,
      numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are
      allowed. Label keys must start with a letter and each label in the list
      must have a different key.

  Fields:
    connectionProperties: Optional. Connection properties which can modify the
      query behavior.
    continuous: [Optional] Specifies whether the query should be executed as a
      continuous query. The default value is false.
    createSession: Optional. If true, creates a new session using a randomly
      generated session_id. If false, runs query with an existing session_id
      passed in ConnectionProperty, otherwise runs query in non-session mode.
      The session location will be set to QueryRequest.location if it is
      present, otherwise it's set to the default location based on existing
      routing logic.
    defaultDataset: Optional. Specifies the default datasetId and projectId to
      assume for any unqualified table names in the query. If not set, all
      table names in the query string must be qualified in the format
      'datasetId.tableId'.
    dryRun: Optional. If set to true, BigQuery doesn't run the job. Instead,
      if the query is valid, BigQuery returns statistics about the job such as
      how many bytes would be processed. If the query is invalid, an error
      returns. The default value is false.
    formatOptions: Optional. Output format adjustments.
    jobCreationMode: Optional. If not set, jobs are always required. If set,
      the query request will follow the behavior described JobCreationMode.
      This feature is not yet available. Jobs will always be created.
    kind: The resource type of the request.
    labels: Optional. The labels associated with this query. Labels can be
      used to organize and group query jobs. Label keys and values can be no
      longer than 63 characters, can only contain lowercase letters, numeric
      characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are
      allowed. Label keys must start with a letter and each label in the list
      must have a different key.
    location: The geographic location where the job should run. See details at
      https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations#specifying_your_locatio
      n.
    maxResults: Optional. The maximum number of rows of data to return per
      page of results. Setting this flag to a small value such as 1000 and
      then paging through results might improve reliability when the query
      result set is large. In addition to this limit, responses are also
      limited to 10 MB. By default, there is no maximum row count, and only
      the byte limit applies.
    maximumBytesBilled: Optional. Limits the bytes billed for this query.
      Queries with bytes billed above this limit will fail (without incurring
      a charge). If unspecified, the project default is used.
    parameterMode: GoogleSQL only. Set to POSITIONAL to use positional (?)
      query parameters or to NAMED to use named (@myparam) query parameters in
      this query.
    preserveNulls: This property is deprecated.
    query: Required. A query string to execute, using Google Standard SQL or
      legacy SQL syntax. Example: "SELECT COUNT(f1) FROM
      myProjectId.myDatasetId.myTableId".
    queryParameters: Query parameters for GoogleSQL queries.
    requestId: Optional. A unique user provided identifier to ensure
      idempotent behavior for queries. Note that this is different from the
      job_id. It has the following properties: 1. It is case-sensitive,
      limited to up to 36 ASCII characters. A UUID is recommended. 2. Read
      only queries can ignore this token since they are nullipotent by
      definition. 3. For the purposes of idempotency ensured by the
      request_id, a request is considered duplicate of another only if they
      have the same request_id and are actually duplicates. When determining
      whether a request is a duplicate of another request, all parameters in
      the request that may affect the result are considered. For example,
      query, connection_properties, query_parameters, use_legacy_sql are
      parameters that affect the result and are considered when determining
      whether a request is a duplicate, but properties like timeout_ms don't
      affect the result and are thus not considered. Dry run query requests
      are never considered duplicate of another request. 4. When a duplicate
      mutating query request is detected, it returns: a. the results of the
      mutation if it completes successfully within the timeout. b. the running
      operation if it is still in progress at the end of the timeout. 5. Its
      lifetime is limited to 15 minutes. In other words, if two requests are
      sent with the same request_id, but more than 15 minutes apart,
      idempotency is not guaranteed.
    timeoutMs: Optional. Optional: Specifies the maximum amount of time, in
      milliseconds, that the client is willing to wait for the query to
      complete. By default, this limit is 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds). If
      the query is complete, the jobComplete field in the response is true. If
      the query has not yet completed, jobComplete is false. You can request a
      longer timeout period in the timeoutMs field. However, the call is not
      guaranteed to wait for the specified timeout; it typically returns after
      around 200 seconds (200,000 milliseconds), even if the query is not
      complete. If jobComplete is false, you can continue to wait for the
      query to complete by calling the getQueryResults method until the
      jobComplete field in the getQueryResults response is true.
    useLegacySql: Specifies whether to use BigQuery's legacy SQL dialect for
      this query. The default value is true. If set to false, the query will
      use BigQuery's GoogleSQL: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-
      reference/ When useLegacySql is set to false, the value of
      flattenResults is ignored; query will be run as if flattenResults is
      false.
    useQueryCache: Optional. Whether to look for the result in the query
      cache. The query cache is a best-effort cache that will be flushed
      whenever tables in the query are modified. The default value is true.

      definition_body is `return "\n";\n` Note that both \n are replaced with
      linebreaks.

    determinismLevel: Optional. The determinism level of the JavaScript UDF,

    importedLibraries: Optional. If language = "JAVASCRIPT", this field stores
      the path of the imported JAVASCRIPT libraries.
    language: Optional. Defaults to "SQL" if remote_function_options field is
      absent, not set otherwise.
    lastModifiedTime: Output only. The time when this routine was last
      modified, in milliseconds since the epoch.
    remoteFunctionOptions: Optional. Remote function specific options.
    returnTableType: Optional. Can be set only if routine_type =
      "TABLE_VALUED_FUNCTION". If absent, the return table type is inferred
      from definition_body at query time in each query that references this
      routine. If present, then the columns in the evaluated table result will
      be cast to match the column types specified in return table type, at
      query time.
    returnType: Optional if language = "SQL"; required otherwise. Cannot be
      set if routine_type = "TABLE_VALUED_FUNCTION". If absent, the return
      type is inferred from definition_body at query time in each query that
      references this routine. If present, then the evaluated result will be
      cast to the specified returned type at query time. For example, for the
      functions created with the following statements: * `CREATE FUNCTION
      Add(x FLOAT64, y FLOAT64) RETURNS FLOAT64 AS (x + y);` * `CREATE
      FUNCTION Increment(x FLOAT64) AS (Add(x, 1));` * `CREATE FUNCTION
      Decrement(x FLOAT64) RETURNS FLOAT64 AS (Add(x, -1));` The return_type
      is `{type_kind: "FLOAT64"}` for `Add` and `Decrement`, and is absent for
      `Increment` (inferred as FLOAT64 at query time). Suppose the function
      `Add` is replaced by `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION Add(x INT64, y INT64)
      AS (x + y);` Then the inferred return type of `Increment` is
      automatically changed to INT64 at query time, while the return type of
      `Decrement` remains FLOAT64.
    routineReference: Required. Reference describing the ID of this routine.
    routineType: Required. The type of routine.
    securityMode: Optional. The security mode of the routine, if defined. If
      not defined, the security mode is automatically determined from the
      routine's configuration.
    sparkOptions: Optional. Spark specific options.
    strictMode: Optional. Use this option to catch many common errors. Error
      checking is not exhaustive, and successfully creating a procedure
      doesn't guarantee that the procedure will successfully execute at
      runtime. If `strictMode` is set to `TRUE`, the procedure body is further
      checked for errors such as non-existent tables or columns. The `CREATE
      PROCEDURE` statement fails if the body fails any of these checks. If
      `strictMode` is set to `FALSE`, the procedure body is checked only for
      syntax. For procedures that invoke themselves recursively, specify
      `strictMode=FALSE` to avoid non-existent procedure errors during
      validation. Default value is `TRUE`.
