  ------ ## Breakpoint (the resource) Represents the breakpoint specification,
  status and results.

  Enums:
    ActionValueValuesEnum: Action that the agent should perform when the code
      at the breakpoint location is hit.
    LogLevelValueValuesEnum: Indicates the severity of the log. Only relevant
      when action is `LOG`.
    StateValueValuesEnum: The current state of the breakpoint.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: A set of custom breakpoint properties, populated by the
      agent, to be displayed to the user.

  Fields:
    action: Action that the agent should perform when the code at the
      breakpoint location is hit.
    canaryExpireTime: The deadline for the breakpoint to stay in CANARY_ACTIVE
      state. The value is meaningless when the breakpoint is not in
      CANARY_ACTIVE state.
    condition: Condition that triggers the breakpoint. The condition is a
      compound boolean expression composed using expressions in a programming
      language at the source location.
    createTime: Time this breakpoint was created by the server in seconds
      resolution.
    evaluatedExpressions: Values of evaluated expressions at breakpoint time.
      The evaluated expressions appear in exactly the same order they are
      listed in the `expressions` field. The `name` field holds the original
      expression text, the `value` or `members` field holds the result of the
      evaluated expression. If the expression cannot be evaluated, the
      `status` inside the `Variable` will indicate an error and contain the
      error text.
    expressions: List of read-only expressions to evaluate at the breakpoint
      location. The expressions are composed using expressions in the
      programming language at the source location. If the breakpoint action is
      `LOG`, the evaluated expressions are included in log statements.
    finalTime: Time this breakpoint was finalized as seen by the server in
      seconds resolution.
    id: Breakpoint identifier, unique in the scope of the debuggee.
    isFinalState: When true, indicates that this is a final result and the
      breakpoint state will not change from here on.
    labels: A set of custom breakpoint properties, populated by the agent, to
      be displayed to the user.
    location: Breakpoint source location.
    logLevel: Indicates the severity of the log. Only relevant when action is
      `LOG`.
    logMessageFormat: Only relevant when action is `LOG`. Defines the message
      to log when the breakpoint hits. The message may include parameter
      placeholders `$0`, `$1`, etc. These placeholders are replaced with the
      evaluated value of the appropriate expression. Expressions not
      referenced in `log_message_format` are not logged. Example: `Message
      received, id = $0, count = $1` with `expressions` = `[ message.id,
      message.count ]`.
    stackFrames: The stack at breakpoint time, where stack_frames[0]
      represents the most recently entered function.
    state: The current state of the breakpoint.
    status: Breakpoint status. The status includes an error flag and a human
      readable message. This field is usually unset. The message can be either
      informational or an error message. Regardless, clients should always
      display the text message back to the user. Error status indicates
      complete failure of the breakpoint. Example (non-final state): `Still
      loading symbols...` Examples (final state): * `Invalid line number`
      referring to location * `Field f not found in class C` referring to
      condition
    userEmail: E-mail address of the user that created this breakpoint
    variableTable: The `variable_table` exists to aid with computation, memory
      and network traffic optimization. It enables storing a variable once and
      reference it from multiple variables, including variables stored in the
      `variable_table` itself. For example, the same `this` object, which may
      appear at many levels of the stack, can have all of its data stored once
      in this table. The stack frame variables then would hold only a
      reference to it. The variable `var_table_index` field is an index into
      this repeated field. The stored objects are nameless and get their name
      from the referencing variable. The effective variable is a merge of the
      referencing variable and the referenced variable.

  compound object: struct T { int m1; int m2; }; T x = { 3, 7 }; { // Captured
  variable name: "x", type: "T", members { name: "m1", value: "3", type: "int"
  }, members { name: "m2", value: "7", type: "int" } } 3) A pointer where the
  pointee was captured: T x = { 3, 7 }; T* p = &x; { // Captured variable
  name: "p", type: "T*", value: "0x00500500", members { name: "m1", value:
  "3", type: "int" }, members { name: "m2", value: "7", type: "int" } } 4) A
  pointer where the pointee was not captured: T* p = new T; { // Captured
  variable name: "p", type: "T*", value: "0x00400400" status { is_error: true,
  description { format: "unavailable" } } } The status should describe the
  reason for the missing value, such as ``, ``, ``. Note that a null pointer
  should not have members. 5) An unnamed value: int* p = new int(7); { //
  Captured variable name: "p", value: "0x00500500", type: "int*", members {
  value: "7", type: "int" } } 6) An unnamed pointer where the pointee was not
  captured: int* p = new int(7); int** pp = &p; { // Captured variable name:
  "pp", value: "0x00500500", type: "int**", members { value: "0x00400400",
  type: "int*" status { is_error: true, description: { format: "unavailable" }
  } } } } To optimize computation, memory and network traffic, variables that
  repeat in the output multiple times can be stored once in a shared variable
  table and be referenced using the `var_table_index` field. The variables
  stored in the shared table are nameless and are essentially a partition of
  the complete variable. To reconstruct the complete variable, merge the
  referencing variable with the referenced variable. When using the shared
  variable table, the following variables: T x = { 3, 7 }; T* p = &x; T& r =
  x; { name: "x", var_table_index: 3, type: "T" } // Captured variables {
  name: "p", value "0x00500500", type="T*", var_table_index: 3 } { name: "r",
  type="T&", var_table_index: 3 } { // Shared variable table entry #3: members
  { name: "m1", value: "3", type: "int" }, members { name: "m2", value: "7",
  type: "int" } } Note that the pointer address is stored with the referencing
  variable and not with the referenced variable. This allows the referenced
  variable to be shared between pointers and references. The type field is
  optional. The debugger agent may or may not support it.

  Fields:
    members: Members contained or pointed to by the variable.
    name: Name of the variable, if any.
    status: Status associated with the variable. This field will usually stay
      unset. A status of a single variable only applies to that variable or
      expression. The rest of breakpoint data still remains valid. Variables
      might be reported in error state even when breakpoint is not in final
      state. The message may refer to variable name with `refers_to` set to
      `VARIABLE_NAME`. Alternatively `refers_to` will be set to
      `VARIABLE_VALUE`. In either case variable value and members will be
      unset. Example of error message applied to name: `Invalid expression
      syntax`. Example of information message applied to value: `Not
      captured`. Examples of error message applied to value: * `Malformed
      string`, * `Field f not found in class C` * `Null pointer dereference`
    type: Variable type (e.g. `MyClass`). If the variable is split with
      `var_table_index`, `type` goes next to `value`. The interpretation of a
      type is agent specific. It is recommended to include the dynamic type
      rather than a static type of an object.
    value: Simple value of the variable.
    varTableIndex: Reference to a variable in the shared variable table. More
      than one variable can reference the same variable in the table. The
      `var_table_index` field is an index into `variable_table` in Breakpoint.
