  sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ
  logging. It also exempts `jose@example.com` from DATA_READ logging, and
  `aliya@example.com` from DATA_WRITE logging.

      binding. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
      policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
    members: Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud
      resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A

      or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special
      identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google
      account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from

      An identifier for a [Kubernetes service
      account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-

      example, `admins@example.com`. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain
      (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example,

      recently deleted. For example,
      `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is recovered,

    dockerRepository: Repository in Artifact Registry to which the function
      docker image will be pushed after it is built by Cloud Build. If
      specified by user, it is created and managed by user with a customer

      Cross-project repositories are not supported. Cross-location
      repositories are not supported. Repository format must be 'DOCKER'.

    environmentVariables: User-provided build-time environment variables for
      the function
    onDeployUpdatePolicy: A OnDeployUpdatePolicy attribute.
    runtime: The runtime in which to run the function. Required when deploying

    source: The location of the function source code.
    sourceProvenance: Output only. A permanent fixed identifier for source.
    sourceToken: An identifier for Firebase function sources. Disclaimer: This

      `projects/{project}/locations/{region}/workerPools/{workerPool}` where
      {project} and {region} are the project id and region respectively where

  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":

      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).

      that may coexist at a given time. Function instances are kept in idle
      state for a short period after they finished executing the request to
      reduce cold start time for subsequent requests. Setting a minimum
      instance count will ensure that the given number of instances are kept
