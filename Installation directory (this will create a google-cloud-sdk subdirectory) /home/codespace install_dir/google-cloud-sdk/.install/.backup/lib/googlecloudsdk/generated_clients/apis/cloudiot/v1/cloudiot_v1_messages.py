  Fields:
    condition: The condition that is associated with this binding. If the
      condition evaluates to `true`, then this binding applies to the current
      request. If the condition evaluates to `false`, then this binding does
      not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding
      might grant the same role to one or more of the principals in this
      binding. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
      policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
    members: Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud
      resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A
      special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with
      or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special
      identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google
      account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from
      external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. *
      `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google
      account. For example, `alice@example.com` . *
      `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google
      service account. For example, `my-other-
      app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. *
      `serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]`:
      An identifier for a [Kubernetes service
      account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-
      to/kubernetes-service-accounts). For example, `my-
      project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]`. *
      `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For
      example, `admins@example.com`. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain
      (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example,
      `google.com` or `example.com`. * `principal://iam.googleapis.com/locatio
      ns/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}`: A
      single identity in a workforce identity pool. * `principalSet://iam.goog

      identity pool. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email
      address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been
      recently deleted. For example,
      `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is recovered,
      this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains

  Fields:
    blocked: If a device is blocked, connections or requests from this device
      will fail. Can be used to temporarily prevent the device from connecting
      if, for example, the sensor is generating bad data and needs
      maintenance.
    config: The most recent device configuration, which is eventually sent
      from Cloud IoT Core to the device. If not present on creation, the
      configuration will be initialized with an empty payload and version
      value of `1`. To update this field after creation, use the
      `DeviceManager.ModifyCloudToDeviceConfig` method.
    credentials: The credentials used to authenticate this device. To allow
      credential rotation without interruption, multiple device credentials
      can be bound to this device. No more than 3 credentials can be bound to
      a single device at a time. When new credentials are added to a device,
      they are verified against the registry credentials. For details, see the
      description of the `DeviceRegistry.credentials` field.
    gatewayConfig: Gateway-related configuration and state.
    id: The user-defined device identifier. The device ID must be unique
      within a device registry.

      version was sent to the device.
    lastErrorStatus: [Output only] The error message of the most recent error,
      such as a failure to publish to Cloud Pub/Sub. 'last_error_time' is the
      timestamp of this field. If no errors have occurred, this field has an
      empty message and the status code 0 == OK. Otherwise, this field is
      expected to have a status code other than OK.
    lastErrorTime: [Output only] The time the most recent error occurred, such
      as a failure to publish to Cloud Pub/Sub. This field is the timestamp of
      'last_error_status'.
    lastEventTime: [Output only] The last time a telemetry event was received.
      Timestamps are periodically collected and written to storage; they may
      be stale by a few minutes.
    lastHeartbeatTime: [Output only] The last time an MQTT `PINGREQ` was
      received. This field applies only to devices connecting through MQTT.
      MQTT clients usually only send `PINGREQ` messages if the connection is
      idle, and no other messages have been sent. Timestamps are periodically
      collected and written to storage; they may be stale by a few minutes.
    lastStateTime: [Output only] The last time a state event was received.
      Timestamps are periodically collected and written to storage; they may
      be stale by a few minutes.

      populated as a response from the service, it always ends in the device
      numeric ID.
    numId: [Output only] A server-defined unique numeric ID for the device.
      This is a more compact way to identify devices, and it is globally

  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
