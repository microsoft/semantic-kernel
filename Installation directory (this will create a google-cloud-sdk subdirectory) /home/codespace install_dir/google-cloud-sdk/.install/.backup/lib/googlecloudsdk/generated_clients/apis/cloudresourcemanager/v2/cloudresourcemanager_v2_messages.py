  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. `bindings` with no
      members will result in an error.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then
      the existing policy is overwritten.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are 0, 1, and
      3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected.  Policies with
      any conditional bindings must specify version 3. Policies without any
      conditional bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field
      unset.

      resources whose display name starts with "Test". * Query
      `lifecycleState=ACTIVE` returns Folder resources with `lifecycleState`
