  an HTTP request via an AppEngineHttpTarget.http_method such as HTTP POST,
  HTTP GET, etc. The job is acknowledged by means of an HTTP response code in
  the range [200 - 299]. Error 503 is considered an App Engine system error
  instead of an application error. Requests returning error 503 will be
  retried regardless of retry configuration and not counted against retry
  counts. Any other response code, or a failure to receive a response before
  the deadline, constitutes a failed execution.

    HeadersValue: HTTP request headers. This map contains the header field
      names and values. Headers can be set when the job is created. Cloud
      Scheduler sets some headers to default values: * `User-Agent`: By
      default, this header is `"AppEngine-Google;
      (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"`. This header can be modified, but
      Cloud Scheduler will append `"AppEngine-Google;
      (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"` to the modified `User-Agent`. *
      `X-CloudScheduler`: This header will be set to true. *
      `X-CloudScheduler-JobName`: This header will contain the job name. *
      `X-CloudScheduler-ScheduleTime`: For Cloud Scheduler jobs specified in
      the unix-cron format, this header will contain the job schedule as an
      offset of UTC parsed according to RFC3339. If the job has a body and the
      following headers are not set by the user, Cloud Scheduler sets default
      values: * `Content-Type`: This will be set to `"application/octet-
      stream"`. You can override this default by explicitly setting `Content-
      Type` to a particular media type when creating the job. For example, you
      can set `Content-Type` to `"application/json"`. The headers below are
      output only. They cannot be set or overridden: * `Content-Length`: This
      is computed by Cloud Scheduler. * `X-Google-*`: For Google internal use
      only. * `X-AppEngine-*`: For Google internal use only. In addition, some
      App Engine headers, which contain job-specific information, are also be
      sent to the job handler.

  Fields:

      Engine HTTP targets, 0 indicates that the request has the default

    pubsubTarget: Pub/Sub target.
    retryConfig: Settings that determine the retry behavior.
    schedule: Specifies a schedule of start times. This can be used to specify
      complicated and time-zone-aware schedules. A scheduled start time will
      be delayed if the previous execution has not ended when its scheduled
      time occurs. If RetryConfig.retry_count > 0 and a job attempt fails, the

      A job's retry interval starts at min_backoff_duration, then doubles
      `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at
      intervals of max_backoff_duration up to retry_count times. For example,
