  Fields:
    consumedParallelism: Total amount of parallelism in the portion of input
      of this task that has already been consumed and is no longer active. In
      the first two examples above (see remaining_parallelism), the value
      should be 29 or 2 respectively. The sum of remaining_parallelism and
      consumed_parallelism should equal the total amount of parallelism in
      this work item. If specified, must be finite.
    fractionConsumed: Completion as fraction of the input consumed, from 0.0
      (beginning, nothing consumed), to 1.0 (end of the input, entire input
      consumed).
    position: A Position within the work to represent a progress.
    remainingParallelism: Total amount of parallelism in the input of this
      task that remains, (i.e. can be delegated to this task and any new tasks
      via dynamic splitting). Always at least 1 for non-finished work items
      and 0 for finished. "Amount of parallelism" refers to how many non-empty
      parts of the input can be read in parallel. This does not necessarily
      equal number of records. An input that can be read in parallel down to
      the individual records is called "perfectly splittable". An example of
      non-perfectly parallelizable input is a block-compressed file format
      where a block of records has to be read as a whole, but different blocks
      can be read in parallel. Examples: * If we are processing record #30
      (starting at 1) out of 50 in a perfectly splittable 50-record input,
      this value should be 21 (20 remaining + 1 current). * If we are reading
      through block 3 in a block-compressed file consisting of 5 blocks, this
      value should be 3 (since blocks 4 and 5 can be processed in parallel by
      new tasks via dynamic splitting and the current task remains processing
      block 3). * If we are reading through the last block in a block-
      compressed file, or reading or processing the last record in a perfectly
      splittable input, this value should be 1, because apart from the current
      task, no additional remainder can be split off.

    projectId: The ID of the Google Cloud project that the job belongs to.
    replaceJobId: If this job is an update of an existing job, this field is
      the job ID of the job it replaced. When sending a `CreateJobRequest`,
      you can update a job by specifying it here. The job named here is
      stopped, and its intermediate state is transferred to this job.
    replacedByJobId: If another job is an update of this job (and thus, this

    stageStates: This field may be mutated by the Cloud Dataflow service;
      callers cannot mutate it.
    startTime: The timestamp when the job was started (transitioned to
      JOB_STATE_PENDING). Flexible resource scheduling jobs are started with
      some delay after job creation, so start_time is unset before start and
      is updated when the job is started by the Cloud Dataflow service. For
      other jobs, start_time always equals to create_time and is immutable and
      set by the Cloud Dataflow service.
    steps: Exactly one of step or steps_location should be specified. The top-
      level steps that constitute the entire job. Only retrieved with
      JOB_VIEW_ALL.
    stepsLocation: The Cloud Storage location where the steps are stored.
    tempFiles: A set of files the system should be aware of that are used for
      temporary storage. These temporary files will be removed on job
      completion. No duplicates are allowed. No file patterns are supported.

  Fields:
    baseSpecs: While splitting, sources may specify the produced bundles as

      and allow bigger jobs. For details, see SourceSplitRequest. To support
      this use case, the full set of parameters of the source is logically

      anything in base_specs).
    codec: The codec to use to decode data read from the source.
    doesNotNeedSplitting: Setting this value to true hints to the framework
      that the source doesn't need splitting, and using SourceSplitRequest on
      it would yield SOURCE_SPLIT_OUTCOME_USE_CURRENT. E.g. a file splitter
      may set this to true when splitting a single file into a set of byte
      ranges of appropriate size, and set this to false when splitting a
      filepattern into individual files. However, for efficiency, a file

    reportIndex: The report index. When a WorkItem is leased, the lease will
      contain an initial report index. When a WorkItem's status is reported to
      the system, the report should be sent with that report index, and the
      response will contain the index the worker should use for the next
      report. Reports received with unexpected index values will be rejected
      by the service. In order to preserve idempotency, the worker should not
      alter the contents of a report, even if the worker must submit the same
      report multiple times before getting back a response. The worker should
      not submit a subsequent report until the response for the previous
      report had been received from the service.
    reportedProgress: The worker's progress through this WorkItem.

    sourceOperationResponse: If the work item represented a
      SourceOperationRequest, and the work is completed, contains the result
      of the operation.
    stopPosition: A worker may split an active map task in two parts,
      "primary" and "residual", continuing to process the primary part and
      returning the residual part into the pool of available work. This event
      is called a "dynamic split" and is critical to the dynamic work
      rebalancing feature. The two obtained sub-tasks are called "parts" of
      the split. The parts, if concatenated, must represent the same input as
      would be read by the current task if the split did not happen. The exact
      way in which the original task is decomposed into the two parts is
      specified either as a position demarcating them (stop_position), or
      explicitly as two DerivedSources, if this task consumes a user-defined
      source type (dynamic_source_split). The "current" task is adjusted as a
      result of the split: after a task with range [A, B) sends a
      stop_position update at C, its range is considered to be [A, C), e.g.: *
      Progress should be interpreted relative to the new range, e.g. "75%
      completed" means "75% of [A, C) completed" * The worker should interpret
      proposed_stop_position relative to the new range, e.g. "split at 68%"
      should be interpreted as "split at 68% of [A, C)". * If the worker
      chooses to split again using stop_position, only stop_positions in [A,
      C) will be accepted. * Etc. dynamic_source_split has similar semantics:
      e.g., if a task with source S splits using dynamic_source_split into {P,
      R} (where P and R must be together equivalent to S), then subsequent
      progress and proposed_stop_position should be interpreted relative to P,
      and in a potential subsequent dynamic_source_split into {P', R'}, P' and
      R' must be together equivalent to P, etc.

    poolArgs: Extra arguments for this worker pool.
    sdkHarnessContainerImages: Set of SDK harness containers needed to execute
      this pipeline. This will only be set in the Fn API path. For non-cross-
      language pipelines this should have only one entry. Cross-language
      pipelines will have two or more entries.
    subnetwork: Subnetwork to which VMs will be assigned, if desired. Expected
      to be of the form "regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNETWORK".
    taskrunnerSettings: Settings passed through to Google Compute Engine
      workers when using the standard Dataflow task runner. Users should
      ignore this field.
    teardownPolicy: Sets the policy for determining when to turndown worker
      pool. Allowed values are: `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS`, `TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS`, and
      `TEARDOWN_NEVER`. `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS` means workers are always torn down
      regardless of whether the job succeeds. `TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS` means
      workers are torn down if the job succeeds. `TEARDOWN_NEVER` means the
      workers are never torn down. If the workers are not torn down by the
      service, they will continue to run and use Google Compute Engine VM
      resources in the user's project until they are explicitly terminated by
      the user. Because of this, Google recommends using the `TEARDOWN_ALWAYS`
      policy except for small, manually supervised test jobs. If unknown or
      unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default.
    workerHarnessContainerImage: Required. Docker container image that
      executes the Cloud Dataflow worker harness, residing in Google Container
      Registry. Deprecated for the Fn API path. Use
      sdk_harness_container_images instead.
    zone: Zone to run the worker pools in. If empty or unspecified, the
      service will attempt to choose a reasonable default.
