class DeploymentmanagerDeploymentsListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A DeploymentmanagerDeploymentsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: The project ID for this request.

  r"""A DeploymentmanagerManifestsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    deployment: The name of the deployment for this request.
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.

  [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/zoneOperations) You can
  use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more
  information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be global, regional
  or zonal. - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource. -
  For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource. - For zonal
  operations, use the `zoneOperations` resource. For more information, read
  Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources. Note that completed Operation
  resources have a limited retention period.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
