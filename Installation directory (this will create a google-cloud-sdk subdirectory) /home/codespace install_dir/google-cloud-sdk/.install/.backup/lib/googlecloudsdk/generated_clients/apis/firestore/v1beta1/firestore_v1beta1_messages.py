  Enums:
    SetToServerValueValueValuesEnum: Sets the field to the given server value.

  Fields:
    appendMissingElements: Append the given elements in order if they are not
      already present in the current field value. If the field is not an
      array, or if the field does not yet exist, it is first set to the empty
      array. Equivalent numbers of different types (e.g. 3L and 3.0) are
      considered equal when checking if a value is missing. NaN is equal to
      NaN, and Null is equal to Null. If the input contains multiple
      equivalent values, only the first will be considered. The corresponding
      transform_result will be the null value.
    fieldPath: The path of the field. See Document.fields for the field path
      syntax reference.
    increment: Adds the given value to the field's current value. This must be
      an integer or a double value. If the field is not an integer or double,
      or if the field does not yet exist, the transformation will set the
      field to the given value. If either of the given value or the current
      field value are doubles, both values will be interpreted as doubles.
      Double arithmetic and representation of double values follow IEEE 754
      semantics. If there is positive/negative integer overflow, the field is
      resolved to the largest magnitude positive/negative integer.
    maximum: Sets the field to the maximum of its current value and the given
      value. This must be an integer or a double value. If the field is not an
      integer or double, or if the field does not yet exist, the
      transformation will set the field to the given value. If a maximum
      operation is applied where the field and the input value are of mixed
      types (that is - one is an integer and one is a double) the field takes
      on the type of the larger operand. If the operands are equivalent (e.g.
      3 and 3.0), the field does not change. 0, 0.0, and -0.0 are all zero.
      The maximum of a zero stored value and zero input value is always the
      stored value. The maximum of any numeric value x and NaN is NaN.
    minimum: Sets the field to the minimum of its current value and the given
      value. This must be an integer or a double value. If the field is not an
      integer or double, or if the field does not yet exist, the
      transformation will set the field to the input value. If a minimum
      operation is applied where the field and the input value are of mixed
      types (that is - one is an integer and one is a double) the field takes
      on the type of the smaller operand. If the operands are equivalent (e.g.
      3 and 3.0), the field does not change. 0, 0.0, and -0.0 are all zero.
      The minimum of a zero stored value and zero input value is always the
      stored value. The minimum of any numeric value x and NaN is NaN.
    removeAllFromArray: Remove all of the given elements from the array in the
      field. If the field is not an array, or if the field does not yet exist,
      it is set to the empty array. Equivalent numbers of the different types
      (e.g. 3L and 3.0) are considered equal when deciding whether an element
      should be removed. NaN is equal to NaN, and Null is equal to Null. This
      will remove all equivalent values if there are duplicates. The

  limit

  Fields:
    endAt: A potential prefix of a position in the result set to end the query
      at. This is similar to `START_AT` but with it controlling the end
      position rather than the start position. Requires: * The number of
      values cannot be greater than the number of fields specified in the
      `ORDER BY` clause.
    from_: The collections to query.
    limit: The maximum number of results to return. Applies after all other
      constraints. Requires: * The value must be greater than or equal to zero
      if specified.
    offset: The number of documents to skip before returning the first result.
      This applies after the constraints specified by the `WHERE`, `START AT`,
      & `END AT` but before the `LIMIT` clause. Requires: * The value must be
      greater than or equal to zero if specified.
    orderBy: The order to apply to the query results. Firestore allows callers
      to provide a full ordering, a partial ordering, or no ordering at all.
      In all cases, Firestore guarantees a stable ordering through the
      following rules: * The `order_by` is required to reference all fields
      used with an inequality filter. * All fields that are required to be in
      the `order_by` but are not already present are appended in
      lexicographical ordering of the field name. * If an order on `__name__`
      is not specified, it is appended by default. Fields are appended with
      the same sort direction as the last order specified, or 'ASCENDING' if
      no order was specified. For example: * `ORDER BY a` becomes `ORDER BY a
      ASC, __name__ ASC` * `ORDER BY a DESC` becomes `ORDER BY a DESC,
      __name__ DESC` * `WHERE a > 1` becomes `WHERE a > 1 ORDER BY a ASC,
      __name__ ASC` * `WHERE __name__ > ... AND a > 1` becomes `WHERE __name__
      > ... AND a > 1 ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC`
    select: Optional sub-set of the fields to return. This acts as a
      DocumentMask over the documents returned from a query. When not set,
      assumes that the caller wants all fields returned.
    startAt: A potential prefix of a position in the result set to start the
      query at. The ordering of the result set is based on the `ORDER BY`
      clause of the original query. ``` SELECT * FROM k WHERE a = 1 AND b > 2
      ORDER BY b ASC, __name__ ASC; ``` This query's results are ordered by
      `(b ASC, __name__ ASC)`. Cursors can reference either the full ordering
      or a prefix of the location, though it cannot reference more fields than
      what are in the provided `ORDER BY`. Continuing off the example above,
      attaching the following start cursors will have varying impact: - `START
      BEFORE (2, /k/123)`: start the query right before `a = 1 AND b > 2 AND
      __name__ > /k/123`. - `START AFTER (10)`: start the query right after `a
      = 1 AND b > 10`. Unlike `OFFSET` which requires scanning over the first
      N results to skip, a start cursor allows the query to begin at a logical
      position. This position is not required to match an actual result, it
      will scan forward from this position to find the next document.
      Requires: * The number of values cannot be greater than the number of
      fields specified in the `ORDER BY` clause.

      be set only when the operation is `update`. If present, this write is
      equivalent to performing `update` and `transform` to the same document
      atomically and in order.

      WriteResponse it has received. This acknowledges that the client has
      received responses up to this token. After sending this token, earlier

      are too many unacknowledged responses. Leave this field unset when
