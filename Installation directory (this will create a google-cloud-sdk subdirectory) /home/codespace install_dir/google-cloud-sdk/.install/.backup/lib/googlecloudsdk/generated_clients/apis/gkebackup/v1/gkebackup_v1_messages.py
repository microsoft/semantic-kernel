  determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any,
  are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more
  AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a
  specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that
  service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the
  exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with
  multiple AuditConfigs: { "audit_configs": [ { "service": "allServices",
  "audit_log_configs": [ { "log_type": "DATA_READ", "exempted_members": [
  "user:jose@example.com" ] }, { "log_type": "DATA_WRITE" }, { "log_type":

  sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ
  logging. It also exempts `jose@example.com` from DATA_READ logging, and
  `aliya@example.com` from DATA_WRITE logging.

  Fields:
    auditLogConfigs: The configuration for logging of each type of permission.
    service: Specifies a service that will be enabled for audit logging. For

  (the config backup and VolumeBackups). Next id: 29

  Enums:
    StateValueValuesEnum: Output only. Current state of the Backup

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Optional. A set of custom labels supplied by user.

  Fields:
    allNamespaces: Output only. If True, all namespaces were included in the
      Backup.
    clusterMetadata: Output only. Information about the GKE cluster from which
      this Backup was created.
    completeTime: Output only. Completion time of the Backup
    configBackupSizeBytes: Output only. The size of the config backup in
      bytes.
    containsSecrets: Output only. Whether or not the Backup contains
      Kubernetes Secrets. Controlled by the parent BackupPlan's
      include_secrets value.
    containsVolumeData: Output only. Whether or not the Backup contains volume
      data. Controlled by the parent BackupPlan's include_volume_data value.
    createTime: Output only. The timestamp when this Backup resource was
      created.
    deleteLockDays: Optional. Minimum age for this Backup (in days). If this
      field is set to a non-zero value, the Backup will be "locked" against
      deletion (either manual or automatic deletion) for the number of days
      provided (measured from the creation time of the Backup). MUST be an
      integer value between 0-90 (inclusive). Defaults to parent BackupPlan's
      backup_delete_lock_days setting and may only be increased (either at
      creation time or in a subsequent update).
    deleteLockExpireTime: Output only. The time at which an existing delete
      lock will expire for this backup (calculated from create_time +
      delete_lock_days).
    description: Optional. User specified descriptive string for this Backup.
    encryptionKey: Output only. The customer managed encryption key that was
      used to encrypt the Backup's artifacts. Inherited from the parent
      BackupPlan's encryption_key value.
    etag: Output only. `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a
      way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a backup from overwriting
      each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
      in the read-modify-write cycle to perform backup updates in order to
      avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
      `GetBackup`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to
      `UpdateBackup` or `DeleteBackup` to ensure that their change will be
      applied to the same version of the resource.
    labels: Optional. A set of custom labels supplied by user.
    manual: Output only. This flag indicates whether this Backup resource was
      created manually by a user or via a schedule in the BackupPlan. A value
      of True means that the Backup was created manually.
    name: Output only. The fully qualified name of the Backup.
      `projects/*/locations/*/backupPlans/*/backups/*`
    permissiveMode: Output only. If false, Backup will fail when Backup for
      GKE detects Kubernetes configuration that is non-standard or requires
      additional setup to restore. Inherited from the parent BackupPlan's
      permissive_mode value.
    podCount: Output only. The total number of Kubernetes Pods contained in
      the Backup.
    resourceCount: Output only. The total number of Kubernetes resources
      included in the Backup.
    retainDays: Optional. The age (in days) after which this Backup will be
      automatically deleted. Must be an integer value >= 0: - If 0, no
      automatic deletion will occur for this Backup. - If not 0, this must be
      >= delete_lock_days and <= 365. Once a Backup is created, this value may
      only be increased. Defaults to the parent BackupPlan's
      backup_retain_days value.
    retainExpireTime: Output only. The time at which this Backup will be
      automatically deleted (calculated from create_time + retain_days).
    selectedApplications: Output only. If set, the list of
      ProtectedApplications whose resources were included in the Backup.
    selectedNamespaces: Output only. If set, the list of namespaces that were
      included in the Backup.
    sizeBytes: Output only. The total size of the Backup in bytes = config
      backup size + sum(volume backup sizes)
    state: Output only. Current state of the Backup
    stateReason: Output only. Human-readable description of why the backup is
      in the current `state`.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).

      DELETE_AND_RESTORE: When conflicting top-level resources (either
        Namespaces or ProtectedApplications, depending upon the scope) are
        encountered, this will first trigger a delete of the conflicting
        resource AND ALL OF ITS REFERENCED RESOURCES (e.g., all resources in
        the Namespace or all resources referenced by the ProtectedApplication)
        before restoring the resources from the Backup. This mode should only
        be used when you are intending to revert some portion of a cluster to
        an earlier state.
      FAIL_ON_CONFLICT: If conflicting top-level resources (either Namespaces
        or ProtectedApplications, depending upon the scope) are encountered at
        the beginning of a restore process, the Restore will fail. If a
        conflict occurs during the restore process itself (e.g., because an
        out of band process creates conflicting resources), a conflict will be
        reported.
      MERGE_SKIP_ON_CONFLICT: This mode merges the backup and the target
        cluster and skips the conflicting resources. If a single resource to
        restore exists in the cluster before restoration, the resource will be
        skipped, otherwise it will be restored.
      MERGE_REPLACE_VOLUME_ON_CONFLICT: This mode merges the backup and the
        target cluster and skips the conflicting resources except volume data.
        If a PVC to restore already exists, this mode will restore/reconnect
        the volume without overwriting the PVC. It is similar to
        MERGE_SKIP_ON_CONFLICT except that it will apply the volume data
        policy for the conflicting PVCs: - RESTORE_VOLUME_DATA_FROM_BACKUP:
        restore data only and respect the reclaim policy of the original PV; -

        policy of the original PV; - NO_VOLUME_DATA_RESTORATION: new provision
        and respect the reclaim policy of the original PV. Note that this mode
        could cause data loss as the original PV can be retained or deleted
        depending on its reclaim policy.
      MERGE_REPLACE_ON_CONFLICT: This mode merges the backup and the target
        cluster and replaces the conflicting resources with the ones in the
        backup. If a single resource to restore exists in the cluster before
        restoration, the resource will be replaced with the one from the
        backup. To replace an existing resource, the first attempt is to
        update the resource to match the one from the backup; if the update
        fails, the second attempt is to delete the resource and restore it
        from the backup. Note that this mode could cause data loss as it
