        Policy Controller is not fully installed on the cluster. In this state
        the hub can be expected to be taking actions to install the PC on the
        cluster.
      ACTIVE: Policy Controller (PC) is fully installed on the cluster and in
        an operational mode. In this state the Hub Feature controller will be
        reconciling state with the PC, and the PC will be performing it's
        operational tasks per that software. Entering a READY state requires
        that the hub has confirmed the PC is installed and its pods are
        operational with the version of the PC the Hub Feature controller
        expects.
      UPDATING: Policy Controller (PC) is fully installed, but in the process
        of changing the configuration (including changing the version of PC
        either up and down, or modifying the manifests of PC) of the resources
        running on the cluster. The Hub Feature controller has a Membership,
        is aware of the version the cluster should be running in, but has not
        confirmed for itself that the PC is running with that version.
      DECOMMISSIONING: Policy Controller (PC) may have resources on the
        cluster, but the Hub Feature controller wishes to remove the
        Membership. The Membership still exists.
      CLUSTER_ERROR: Policy Controller (PC) is not operational, and the Hub
        Feature controller is unable to act to make it operational. Entering a
        CLUSTER_ERROR state happens automatically when the PCH determines that
        a PC installed on the cluster is non-operative or that the cluster
        does not meet requirements set for the Hub Feature controller to
        administer the cluster but has nevertheless been given an instruction
        to do so (such as 'install').
      HUB_ERROR: In this state, the PC may still be operational, and only the
        Hub Feature controller is unable to act. The hub should not issue
        instructions to change the PC state, or otherwise interfere with the
        on-cluster resources. Entering a HUB_ERROR state happens automatically
        when the Hub Feature controller determines the hub is in an unhealthy
        state and it wishes to 'take hands off' to avoid corrupting the PC or
        other data.
      SUSPENDED: Policy Controller (PC) is installed but suspended. This means
        that the policies are not enforced, but violations are still recorded

  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    rules: If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the
      following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any
      DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied. Logging will be
      applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if
      any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is granted. Logging
      will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. -
      Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).

      NOT_INSTALLED: Policy Controller (PC) does not exist on the given
        cluster, and no k8s resources of any type that are associated with the
        PC should exist there. The cluster does not possess a membership with
        the Hub Feature controller.
      INSTALLING: The Hub Feature controller possesses a Membership, however
        Policy Controller is not fully installed on the cluster. In this state
        the hub can be expected to be taking actions to install the PC on the
        cluster.
      ACTIVE: Policy Controller (PC) is fully installed on the cluster and in
        an operational mode. In this state the Hub Feature controller will be
        reconciling state with the PC, and the PC will be performing it's
        operational tasks per that software. Entering a READY state requires
        that the hub has confirmed the PC is installed and its pods are
        operational with the version of the PC the Hub Feature controller
        expects.
      UPDATING: Policy Controller (PC) is fully installed, but in the process
        of changing the configuration (including changing the version of PC
        either up and down, or modifying the manifests of PC) of the resources
        running on the cluster. The Hub Feature controller has a Membership,
        is aware of the version the cluster should be running in, but has not
        confirmed for itself that the PC is running with that version.
      DECOMMISSIONING: Policy Controller (PC) may have resources on the
        cluster, but the Hub Feature controller wishes to remove the
        Membership. The Membership still exists.
      CLUSTER_ERROR: Policy Controller (PC) is not operational, and the Hub
        Feature controller is unable to act to make it operational. Entering a
        CLUSTER_ERROR state happens automatically when the PCH determines that
        a PC installed on the cluster is non-operative or that the cluster
        does not meet requirements set for the Hub Feature controller to
        administer the cluster but has nevertheless been given an instruction
        to do so (such as 'install').
      HUB_ERROR: In this state, the PC may still be operational, and only the
        Hub Feature controller is unable to act. The hub should not issue
        instructions to change the PC state, or otherwise interfere with the
        on-cluster resources. Entering a HUB_ERROR state happens automatically
        when the Hub Feature controller determines the hub is in an unhealthy
        state and it wishes to 'take hands off' to avoid corrupting the PC or
        other data.
      SUSPENDED: Policy Controller (PC) is installed but suspended. This means
        that the policies are not enforced, but violations are still recorded
