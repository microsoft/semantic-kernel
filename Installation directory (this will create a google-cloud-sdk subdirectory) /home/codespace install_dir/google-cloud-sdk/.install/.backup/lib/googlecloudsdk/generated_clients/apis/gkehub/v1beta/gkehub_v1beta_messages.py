      ATTRIBUTION: The principal (even if an authority selector is present),
        which must only be used for attribution, not authorization.
      SECURITY_REALM: Any of the security realms in the IAMContext
        (go/security-realms). When used with IN, the condition indicates "any
        of the request's realms match one of the given values; with NOT_IN,

        membership check performed by a RealmAclRep object (go/realm-acl-

  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    rules: If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the
      following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any
      DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied. Logging will be
      applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if
      any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is granted. Logging
      will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. -
      Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-

      NOT_INSTALLED: The PC does not exist on the given cluster, and no k8s
        resources of any type that are associated with the PC should exist
        there. The cluster does not possess a membership with the PCH.
      INSTALLING: The PCH possesses a Membership, however the PC is not fully
        installed on the cluster. In this state the hub can be expected to be
        taking actions to install the PC on the cluster.
      ACTIVE: The PC is fully installed on the cluster and in an operational
        mode. In this state PCH will be reconciling state with the PC, and the
        PC will be performing it's operational tasks per that software.
        Entering a READY state requires that the hub has confirmed the PC is
        installed and its pods are operational with the version of the PC the
        PCH expects.
      UPDATING: The PC is fully installed, but in the process of changing the
        configuration (including changing the version of PC either up and
        down, or modifying the manifests of PC) of the resources running on
        the cluster. The PCH has a Membership, is aware of the version the
        cluster should be running in, but has not confirmed for itself that
        the PC is running with that version.
      DECOMMISSIONING: The PC may have resources on the cluster, but the PCH
        wishes to remove the Membership. The Membership still exists.
      CLUSTER_ERROR: The PC is not operational, and the PCH is unable to act
        to make it operational. Entering a CLUSTER_ERROR state happens
        automatically when the PCH determines that a PC installed on the
        cluster is non-operative or that the cluster does not meet
        requirements set for the PCH to administer the cluster but has
        nevertheless been given an instruction to do so (such as 'install').
      HUB_ERROR: In this state, the PC may still be operational, and only the
        PCH is unable to act. The hub should not issue instructions to change
        the PC state, or otherwise interfere with the on-cluster resources.
        Entering a HUB_ERROR state happens automatically when the PCH
        determines the hub is in an unhealthy state and it wishes to 'take
        hands off' to avoid corrupting the PC or other data.
      SUSPENDED: Policy Controller (PC) is installed but suspended. This means
        that the policies are not enforced, but violations are still recorded
        (through audit).
      DETACHED: PoCo Hub is not taking any action to reconcile cluster
        objects. Changes to those objects will not be overwritten by PoCo Hub.
