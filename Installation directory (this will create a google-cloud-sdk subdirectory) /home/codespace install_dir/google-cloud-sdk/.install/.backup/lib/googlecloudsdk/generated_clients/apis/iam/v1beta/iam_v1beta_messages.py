  Messages:
    AttributeMappingValue: Maps attributes from authentication credentials
      issued by an external identity provider to Google Cloud attributes, such
      as `subject` and `segment`. Each key must be a string specifying the
      Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are supported:
      * `google.subject`: The principal IAM is authenticating. You can
      reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that
      appears in Cloud Logging logs. Cannot exceed 127 bytes. *
      `google.groups`: Groups the external identity belongs to. You can grant
      groups access to resources using an IAM `principalSet` binding; access
      applies to all members of the group. You can also provide custom
      attributes by specifying `attribute.{custom_attribute}`, where
      `{custom_attribute}` is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped.
      You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The maximum length of
      a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain
      the characters [a-z0-9_]. You can reference these attributes in IAM
      policies to define fine-grained access for a workload to Google Cloud
      resources. For example: * `google.subject`: `principal://iam.googleapis.
      com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}
      /subject/{value}` * `google.groups`: `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/
      projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/gro
      up/{value}` * `attribute.{custom_attribute}`: `principalSet://iam.google
      apis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{
      pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value}` Each value must be a [Common
      Expression Language] (https://opensource.google/projects/cel) function
      that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute
      specified by the corresponding map key. You can use the `assertion`
      keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of the
      authentication credential issued by the provider. The maximum length of
      an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated, the
      total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 8KB. For AWS
      providers, if no attribute mapping is defined, the following default
      mapping applies: ``` { "google.subject":"assertion.arn",
      "attribute.aws_role": "assertion.arn.contains('assumed-role')" " ?
      assertion.arn.extract('{account_arn}assumed-role/')" " + 'assumed-
      role/'" " + assertion.arn.extract('assumed-role/{role_name}/')" " :
      assertion.arn", } ``` If any custom attribute mappings are defined, they
      must include a mapping to the `google.subject` attribute. For OIDC
      providers, you must supply a custom mapping, which must include the
      `google.subject` attribute. For example, the following maps the `sub`
      claim of the incoming credential to the `subject` attribute on a Google
      token: ``` {"google.subject": "assertion.sub"} ```

  Fields:
    attributeCondition: [A Common Expression
      Language](https://opensource.google/projects/cel) expression, in plain
      text, to restrict what otherwise valid authentication credentials issued
      by the provider should not be accepted. The expression must output a
      boolean representing whether to allow the federation. The following
      keywords may be referenced in the expressions: * `assertion`: JSON
      representing the authentication credential issued by the provider. *
      `google`: The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the
      `attribute_mappings`. * `attribute`: The custom attributes mapped from
      the assertion in the `attribute_mappings`. The maximum length of the
      condition expression is 4096 characters. If unspecified, all valid
      authentication credentials are accepted. The following example shows how
      to only allow credentials with a mapped `google.groups` value of
      `admins`: ``` "'admins' in google.groups" ```
    attributeMapping: Maps attributes from authentication credentials issued
      by an external identity provider to Google Cloud attributes, such as
      `subject` and `segment`. Each key must be a string specifying the Google
      Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are supported: *
      `google.subject`: The principal IAM is authenticating. You can reference
      this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that appears in
      Cloud Logging logs. Cannot exceed 127 bytes. * `google.groups`: Groups
      the external identity belongs to. You can grant groups access to
      resources using an IAM `principalSet` binding; access applies to all
      members of the group. You can also provide custom attributes by
      specifying `attribute.{custom_attribute}`, where `{custom_attribute}` is
      the name of the custom attribute to be mapped. You can define a maximum
      of 50 custom attributes. The maximum length of a mapped attribute key is
      100 characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_].
      You can reference these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-
      grained access for a workload to Google Cloud resources. For example: *
      `google.subject`: `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/loc
      ations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/subject/{value}` *

      cts/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/attribut
      e.{custom_attribute}/{value}` Each value must be a [Common Expression
      Language] (https://opensource.google/projects/cel) function that maps an
      identity provider credential to the normalized attribute specified by
      the corresponding map key. You can use the `assertion` keyword in the

  three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can
  find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API
  Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

  Messages:
    DetailsValueListEntry: A DetailsValueListEntry object.

  Fields:
    code: The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    details: A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a
      common set of message types for APIs to use.
    message: A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
      user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
      google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
