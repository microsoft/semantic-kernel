      `iam.googleapis.com/roles.list`.

      service account. For example,
      `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/my-service-

      `principalSet://goog/group/admins@example.com`. *
      `principalSet://goog/public:all`: A special identifier that represents
      any principal that is on the internet, even if they do not have a Google

      am.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{sub
      ject_attribute_value}`: A single identity in a workforce identity pool.
      * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{po

      `deleted:principal://goog/subject/{email_id}?uid={uid}`: A specific
      Google Account that was deleted recently. For example,

      identifier for a Google Account. *

      that was deleted recently. For example,

      Cloud service account that was deleted recently. For example,
      `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/my-

      account is undeleted, this identifier reverts to the standard identifier
      for a service account. * `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locatio
