      services for platform logs. They have two components - a service
      namespace component and the attribute name. For example:
      compute.googleapis.com/resource_name.Cloud Logging truncates label keys
      that exceed 512 B and label values that exceed 64 KB upon their
      associated log entry being written. The truncation is indicated by an
      ellipsis at the end of the character string.
    ProtoPayloadValue: The log entry payload, represented as a protocol
      buffer. Some Google Cloud Platform services use this field for their log
      entry payloads.The following protocol buffer types are supported; user-
      defined types are not
      supported:"type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog"
      "type.googleapis.com/google.appengine.logging.v1.RequestLog"

  Fields:
    errorGroups: Output only. The Error Reporting
      (https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting) error groups associated with
      this LogEntry. Error Reporting sets the values for this field during
      error group creation.For more information, see View error details(
      https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting/docs/viewing-
      errors#view_error_details)This field isn't available during log routing
      (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/overview)
    httpRequest: Optional. Information about the HTTP request associated with
      this log entry, if applicable.
    insertId: Optional. A unique identifier for the log entry. If you provide
      a value, then Logging considers other log entries in the same project,
      with the same timestamp, and with the same insert_id to be duplicates
      which are removed in a single query result. However, there are no
      guarantees of de-duplication in the export of logs.If the insert_id is
      omitted when writing a log entry, the Logging API assigns its own unique
      identifier in this field.In queries, the insert_id is also used to order
      log entries that have the same log_name and timestamp values.
    jsonPayload: The log entry payload, represented as a structure that is
      expressed as a JSON object.
    labels: Optional. A map of key, value pairs that provides additional
      information about the log entry. The labels can be user-defined or
      system-defined.User-defined labels are arbitrary key, value pairs that
      you can use to classify logs.System-defined labels are defined by GCP
      services for platform logs. They have two components - a service
      namespace component and the attribute name. For example:
      compute.googleapis.com/resource_name.Cloud Logging truncates label keys
      that exceed 512 B and label values that exceed 64 KB upon their
      associated log entry being written. The truncation is indicated by an
      ellipsis at the end of the character string.
    logName: Required. The resource name of the log to which this log entry
      belongs: "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      "folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]" A project number may be used in
      place of PROJECT_ID. The project number is translated to its
      corresponding PROJECT_ID internally and the log_name field will contain
      PROJECT_ID in queries and exports.[LOG_ID] must be URL-encoded within
      log_name. Example: "organizations/1234567890/logs/cloudresourcemanager.g
      oogleapis.com%2Factivity".[LOG_ID] must be less than 512 characters long
      and can only include the following characters: upper and lower case
      alphanumeric characters, forward-slash, underscore, hyphen, and
      period.For backward compatibility, if log_name begins with a forward-
      slash, such as /projects/..., then the log entry is processed as usual,
      but the forward-slash is removed. Listing the log entry will not show
      the leading slash and filtering for a log name with a leading slash will
      never return any results.
    metadata: Output only. Deprecated. This field is not used by Logging. Any
      value written to it is cleared.
    operation: Optional. Information about an operation associated with the
      log entry, if applicable.
    protoPayload: The log entry payload, represented as a protocol buffer.
      Some Google Cloud Platform services use this field for their log entry
      payloads.The following protocol buffer types are supported; user-defined
      types are not
      supported:"type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog"
      "type.googleapis.com/google.appengine.logging.v1.RequestLog"
    receiveTimestamp: Output only. The time the log entry was received by
      Logging.
    resource: Required. The monitored resource that produced this log
      entry.Example: a log entry that reports a database error would be
      associated with the monitored resource designating the particular
      database that reported the error.
    severity: Optional. The severity of the log entry. The default value is
      LogSeverity.DEFAULT.
    sourceLocation: Optional. Source code location information associated with
      the log entry, if any.
    spanId: Optional. The ID of the Cloud Trace
      (https://cloud.google.com/trace) span associated with the current
      operation in which the log is being written. For example, if a span has
      the REST resource name of "projects/some-project/traces/some-
      trace/spans/some-span-id", then the span_id field is "some-span-id".A
      Span (https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/projects.
      traces/batchWrite#Span) represents a single operation within a trace.
      Whereas a trace may involve multiple different microservices running on
      multiple different machines, a span generally corresponds to a single
      logical operation being performed in a single instance of a microservice
      on one specific machine. Spans are the nodes within the tree that is a
      trace.Applications that are instrumented for tracing
      (https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/setup) will generally assign a new,
      unique span ID on each incoming request. It is also common to create and
      record additional spans corresponding to internal processing elements as
      well as issuing requests to dependencies.The span ID is expected to be a
      16-character, hexadecimal encoding of an 8-byte array and should not be
      zero. It should be unique within the trace and should, ideally, be
      generated in a manner that is uniformly random.Example values:
      000000000000004a 7a2190356c3fc94b 0000f00300090021 d39223e101960076
    split: Optional. Information indicating this LogEntry is part of a
      sequence of multiple log entries split from a single LogEntry.
    textPayload: The log entry payload, represented as a Unicode string
      (UTF-8).
    timestamp: Optional. The time the event described by the log entry
      occurred. This time is used to compute the log entry's age and to
      enforce the logs retention period. If this field is omitted in a new log
      entry, then Logging assigns it the current time. Timestamps have
      nanosecond accuracy, but trailing zeros in the fractional seconds might
      be omitted when the timestamp is displayed.Incoming log entries must
      have timestamps that don't exceed the logs retention period
      (https://cloud.google.com/logging/quotas#logs_retention_periods) in the
      past, and that don't exceed 24 hours in the future. Log entries outside
      those time boundaries are rejected by Logging.
    trace: Optional. The REST resource name of the trace being written to
      Cloud Trace (https://cloud.google.com/trace) in association with this
      log entry. For example, if your trace data is stored in the Cloud
      project "my-trace-project" and if the service that is creating the log
      entry receives a trace header that includes the trace ID "12345", then
      the service should use "projects/my-trace-project/traces/12345".The
      trace field provides the link between logs and traces. By using this
      field, you can navigate from a log entry to a trace.
    traceSampled: Optional. The sampling decision of the span associated with
      the log entry at the time the log entry was created. This field
      corresponds to the sampled flag in the W3C trace-context specification
      (https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#sampled-flag). A non-sampled trace
      value is still useful as a request correlation identifier. The default
      is False.

    metricDescriptor: Optional. The metric descriptor associated with the
      logs-based metric. If unspecified, it uses a default metric descriptor
      with a DELTA metric kind, INT64 value type, with no labels and a unit of
      "1". Such a metric counts the number of log entries matching the filter
      expression.The name, type, and description fields in the
      metric_descriptor are output only, and is constructed using the name and
      description field in the LogMetric.To create a logs-based metric that
      records a distribution of log values, a DELTA metric kind with a
      DISTRIBUTION value type must be used along with a value_extractor
      expression in the LogMetric.Each label in the metric descriptor must
      have a matching label name as the key and an extractor expression as the
      value in the label_extractors map.The metric_kind and value_type fields
      in the metric_descriptor cannot be updated once initially configured.
      New labels can be added in the metric_descriptor, but existing labels
      cannot be modified except for their description.
    name: Required. The client-assigned metric identifier. Examples:
      "error_count", "nginx/requests".Metric identifiers are limited to 100
      characters and can include only the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9,
      and the special characters _-.,+!*',()%/. The forward-slash character
      (/) denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the first
      character of the name.This field is the [METRIC_ID] part of a metric
      resource name in the format "projects/PROJECT_ID/metrics/METRIC_ID".
      Example: If the resource name of a metric is "projects/my-
      project/metrics/nginx%2Frequests", this field's value is
      "nginx/requests".
    updateTime: Output only. The last update timestamp of the metric.This
      field may not be present for older metrics.
    valueExtractor: Optional. A value_extractor is required when using a
      distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to record from a
      log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction:
      EXTRACT(field) or REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The arguments are:
      field: The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be
      extracted. regex: A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax
      (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture group
      to extract data from the specified log entry field. The value of the
      field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an error
      to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group.The
      result of the extraction must be convertible to a double type, as the
      distribution always records double values. If either the extraction or
      the conversion to double fails, then those values are not recorded in
      the distribution.Example: REGEXP_EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request,
      ".*quantity=(\d+).*")

  entries are exported. The sink must be created within a project,
  organization, billing account, or folder.

  Enums:
    OutputVersionFormatValueValuesEnum: Deprecated. This field is unused.

  Fields:
    bigqueryOptions: Optional. Options that affect sinks exporting data to
      BigQuery.
    createTime: Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may
      not be present for older sinks.
    description: Optional. A description of this sink.The maximum length of
      the description is 8000 characters.
    destination: Required. The export destination:
      "storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]"
      "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]"
      "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]"

      rojects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]" The
      sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have
      permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not
      exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks
      (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs).
    disabled: Optional. If set to true, then this sink is disabled and it does
      not export any log entries.
    exclusions: Optional. Log entries that match any of these exclusion
      filters will not be exported.If a log entry is matched by both filter
      and one of exclusion_filters it will not be exported.
    filter: Optional. An advanced logs filter
      (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only
      exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink
      and that match the filter.For
      example:logName="projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]" AND
      severity>=ERROR
    includeChildren: Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by
      organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the
      logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If
      the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and
      billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also
      available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children
      is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this
      field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export
      all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the
      sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter
      on the project part of the log name:logName:("projects/test-project1/"
      OR "projects/test-project2/") AND resource.type=gce_instance
    interceptChildren: Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by
      organizations and folders.When the value of 'intercept_children' is
      true, the following restrictions apply: The sink must have the
      include_children flag set to true. The sink destination must be a Cloud
      project.Also, the following behaviors apply: Any logs matched by the
      sink won't be included by non-_Required sinks owned by child resources.
      The sink appears in the results of a ListSinks call from a child
      resource if the value of the filter field in its request is either
      'in_scope("ALL")' or 'in_scope("ANCESTOR")'.
    name: Output only. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the
      project.For example: "my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub".Sink identifiers are
      limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters:
      upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens,
      periods.First character has to be alphanumeric.
    outputVersionFormat: Deprecated. This field is unused.

      "folders/[FOLDER_ID]/sinks/[SINK_NAME] For example:
      projects/my_project/sinks/SINK_NAME
    updateTime: Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field
      may not be present for older sinks.
    writerIdentity: Output only. An IAM identity-a service account or group-
      under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's
      destination. This field is either set by specifying
      custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and
      sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those
      methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination,
      log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see

      (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-

      the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM
      roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a

      value_type might not be supported.

  Fields:
    description: A detailed description of the metric, which can be used in
      documentation.
    displayName: A concise name for the metric, which can be displayed in user
      interfaces. Use sentence case without an ending period, for example
      "Request count". This field is optional but it is recommended to be set
      for any metrics associated with user-visible concepts, such as Quota.
    labels: The set of labels that can be used to describe a specific instance
      of this metric type. For example, the
      appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies metric type has
      a label for the HTTP response code, response_code, so you can look at
      latencies for successful responses or just for responses that failed.
    launchStage: Optional. The launch stage of the metric definition.
    metadata: Optional. Metadata which can be used to guide usage of the
      metric.
    metricKind: Whether the metric records instantaneous values, changes to a
      value, etc. Some combinations of metric_kind and value_type might not be
      supported.
    monitoredResourceTypes: Read-only. If present, then a time series, which
      is identified partially by a metric type and a
      MonitoredResourceDescriptor, that is associated with this metric type
      can only be associated with one of the monitored resource types listed
      here.
    name: The resource name of the metric descriptor.
    type: The metric type, including its DNS name prefix. The type is not URL-
      encoded. All user-defined metric types have the DNS name
      custom.googleapis.com or external.googleapis.com. Metric types should
      use a natural hierarchical grouping. For example:
      "custom.googleapis.com/invoice/paid/amount"
      "external.googleapis.com/prometheus/up"
      "appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies"
    unit: The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only
      applicable if the value_type is INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The unit
      defines the representation of the stored metric values.Different systems
      might scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a value of
      0.02kBy might be displayed as 20By, and a value of 3523kBy might be
      displayed as 3.5MBy). However, if the unit is kBy, then the value of the
      metric is always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it might be
      displayed.If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-
      seconds used by a job, you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose
      unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently 1s{CPU} or just s). If the job uses
      12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as 12005.Alternatively, if
      you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you can
      create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write
      the value 12.005 (which is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723
      (which is 12005/1024).The supported units are a subset of The Unified
      Code for Units of Measure (https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html)

      pebi (2^50)GrammarThe grammar also includes these connectors: / division
      or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples, kBy/{email} or MiBy/10ms
      (although you should almost never have /s in a metric unit; rates should
      always be computed at query time from the underlying cumulative or delta
      value). . multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For
      examples, GBy.d or k{watt}.h.The grammar for a unit is as follows:
      Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ; Component =
      ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation
      = "{" NAME "}" ; Notes: Annotation is just a comment if it follows a
      UNIT. If the annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to 1.
      For examples, {request}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s. NAME is a
      sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing { or }.
      1 represents a unitary dimensionless unit
      (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such as in
      1/s. It is typically used when none of the basic units are appropriate.
      For example, "new users per day" can be represented as 1/d or {new-
      users}/d (and a metric value 5 would mean "5 new users). Alternatively,
      "thousands of page views per day" would be represented as 1000/d or k1/d
      or k{page_views}/d (and a metric value of 5.3 would mean "5300 page
      views per day"). % represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and
      annotates values giving a percentage (so the metric values are typically
      in the range of 0..100, and a metric value 3 means "3 percent"). 10^2.%
      indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that
      will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a metric
      value 0.03 means "3 percent").
    valueType: Whether the measurement is an integer, a floating-point number,
      etc. Some combinations of metric_kind and value_type might not be

  Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and
  domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of permissions; each role
  can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.For some types
  of Google Cloud resources, a binding can also specify a condition, which is
  a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
  evaluates to true. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
  the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support
  conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation
  (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).JSON
  example: { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [

  version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the IAM
  documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of members, or principals, with a role.
      Optionally, may specify a condition that determines how and when the
      bindings are applied. Each of the bindings must contain at least one
      principal.The bindings in a Policy can refer to up to 1,500 principals;
      up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a
      principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the bindings
      grant 50 different roles to user:alice@example.com, and not to any other
      principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the bindings in
      the Policy.
    etag: etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to
      ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag
      field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM
      allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and
      all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.Valid values are 0, 1, and 3.
      Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.Any operation that
      affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3. This
      requirement applies to the following operations: Getting a policy that
      includes a conditional role binding Adding a conditional role binding to
      a policy Changing a conditional role binding in a policy Removing any
      role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes
      conditionsImportant: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then
      IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy,
      and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.If a policy
      does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify
      any valid version or leave the field unset.To learn which resources
      support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation

      For more information, see the LogEntry type.If the timestamp or
      insert_id fields are missing in log entries, then this method supplies

      entries, whether the resource is specified in logName or in an
      individual log entry.
    partialSuccess: Optional. Whether a batch's valid entries should be

      zero-based index in the entries. Failed requests for which no entries
      are written will not include per-entry errors.
