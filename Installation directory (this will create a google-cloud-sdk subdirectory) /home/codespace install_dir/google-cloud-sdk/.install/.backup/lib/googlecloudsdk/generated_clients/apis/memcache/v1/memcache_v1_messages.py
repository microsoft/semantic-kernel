      dashboards. See go/get-instance-metadata.

  Fields:
    consumerDefinedName: consumer_defined_name is the name of the instance set
      by the service consumers. Generally this is different from the `name`
      field which reperesents the system-assigned id of the instance which the

      onboarding to Maintenance Window notifications (go/slm-rollout-

    instanceType: Optional. The instance_type of this instance of format: proj
      ects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/instanceTypes/{instance_ty
      pe_id}. Instance Type represents a high-level tier or SKU of the service
      that this instance belong to. When enabled(eg: Maintenance Rollout),
      Rollout uses 'instance_type' along with 'software_versions' to determine
      whether instance needs an update or not.
    labels: Optional. Resource labels to represent user provided metadata.
      Each label is a key-value pair, where both the key and the value are
      arbitrary strings provided by the user.

      attached to the instance. The key must be of the type name of the oneof
      policy name defined in MaintenancePolicy, and the referenced policy must
      define the same policy type. For details, please refer to go/mr-user-
      guide. Should not be set if maintenance_settings.maintenance_policies is
      set.
    maintenanceSchedules: The MaintenanceSchedule contains the scheduling
      information of published maintenance schedule with same key as
      software_versions.
    maintenanceSettings: Optional. The MaintenanceSettings associated with
      instance.
    name: Unique name of the resource. It uses the form: `projects/{project_nu
      mber}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}` Note: This name
      is passed, stored and logged across the rollout system. So use of
      consumer project_id or any other consumer PII in the name is strongly
      discouraged for wipeout (go/wipeout) compliance. See
      go/elysium/project_ids#storage-guidance for more details.
    notificationParameters: Optional. notification_parameter are information
      that service producers may like to include that is not relevant to
      Rollout. This parameter will only be passed to Gamma and Cloud Logging

    provisionedResources: Output only. The list of data plane resources
      provisioned for this instance, e.g. compute VMs. See go/get-instance-

    slmInstanceTemplate: Link to the SLM instance template. Only populated
      when updating SLM instances via SSA's Actuation service adaptor. Service
      producers with custom control plane (e.g. Cloud SQL) doesn't need to
      populate this field. Instead they should use software_versions.
    sloMetadata: Output only. SLO metadata for instance classification in the
      Standardized dataplane SLO platform. See go/cloud-ssa-standard-slo for
      feature description.
    softwareVersions: Software versions that are used to deploy this instance.
      This can be mutated by rollout services.
    state: Output only. Current lifecycle state of the resource (e.g. if it's
