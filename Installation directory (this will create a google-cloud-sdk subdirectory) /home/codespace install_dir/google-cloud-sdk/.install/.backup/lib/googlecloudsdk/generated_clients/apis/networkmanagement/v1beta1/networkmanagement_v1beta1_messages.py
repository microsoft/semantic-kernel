      UNKNOWN_PROJECT: Aborted because no project information can be derived
        from the test input. Deprecated, not used in the new tests.
      NO_EXTERNAL_IP: Aborted because traffic is sent from a public IP to an
        instance without an external IP. Deprecated, not used in the new

        address is found.

        address doesn't belong to any of the subnets of the source VPC
        network.

        endpoint is derived from the input test request.
      INVALID_ARGUMENT: Aborted because the source or destination endpoint
        specified in the request is invalid. Some examples: - The request
        might contain malformed resource URI, project ID, or IP address. - The
        request might contain inconsistent information (for example, the
        request might include both the instance and the network, but the
        instance might not have a NIC in that network).
      TRACE_TOO_LONG: Aborted because the number of steps in the trace exceeds

    createTime: Output only. The time the test was created.
    description: The user-supplied description of the Connectivity Test.
      Maximum of 512 characters.
    destination: Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test.
      You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute Engine VM
      instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the destination location.
      Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP location
      is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination endpoint from
      route information. If the destination you specify is a VM instance and
      the instance has multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify
      either a destination IP address or VPC network to identify the
      destination interface. A reachability analysis proceeds even if the
      destination location is ambiguous. However, the result can include
      endpoints that you don't intend to test.
    displayName: Output only. The display name of a Connectivity Test.
    labels: Resource labels to represent user-provided metadata.
    name: Required. Unique name of the resource using the form:
      `projects/{project_id}/locations/global/connectivityTests/{test}`
    probingDetails: Output only. The probing details of this test from the
      latest run, present for applicable tests only. The details are updated
      when creating a new test, updating an existing test, or triggering a
      one-time rerun of an existing test.
    protocol: IP Protocol of the test. When not provided, "TCP" is assumed.
    reachabilityDetails: Output only. The reachability details of this test
      from the latest run. The details are updated when creating a new test,
      updating an existing test, or triggering a one-time rerun of an existing
      test.
    relatedProjects: Other projects that may be relevant for reachability
      analysis. This is applicable to scenarios where a test can cross project
      boundaries.
    source: Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test. You can
      use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine (VM) instance,
      or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the source location.
      Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within a
      Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must also
      specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance, which
      already contains its internal IP address and VPC network information. If
      the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then you must
      provide the destination VPC network. If the source endpoint is a Compute
      Engine VM instance with multiple network interfaces, the instance itself
      is not sufficient to identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify
      the source IP address or VPC network. A reachability analysis proceeds
      even if the source location is ambiguous. However, the test result may
      include endpoints that you don't intend to test.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
