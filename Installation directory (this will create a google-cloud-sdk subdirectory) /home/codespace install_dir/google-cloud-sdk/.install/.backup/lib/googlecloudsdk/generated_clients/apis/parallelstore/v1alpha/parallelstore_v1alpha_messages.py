  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Optional. Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight
      mechanism for organizing cloud resources into groups that reflect a
      customer's organizational needs and deployment strategies. Cloud Labels
      can be used to filter collections of resources. They can be used to
      control how resource metrics are aggregated. And they can be used as
      arguments to policy management rules (e.g. route, firewall, load
      balancing, etc.). * Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long
      and must conform to the following regular expression: `a-z{0,62}`. *
      Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform
      to the regular expression `[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`. * No more than 64 labels
      can be associated with a given resource. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for
      more information on and examples of labels. If you plan to use labels in
      your own code, please note that additional characters may be allowed in
      the future. Therefore, you are advised to use an internal label
      representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon specific
      characters being disallowed. For example, representing labels as the
      string: name + "_" + value would prove problematic if we were to allow

      create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method

    ResponseValue: The normal, successful response of the operation. If the
      original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the
      response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard
      `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other

    done: If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in

      create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method
      that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type,

    name: The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same
      service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping,
      the `name` should be a resource name ending with
      `operations/{unique_id}`.
