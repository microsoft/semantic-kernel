  use a permission.

  Enums:
    AccessValueValuesEnum: Indicates whether _this binding_ provides the
      specified permission to the specified member for the specified resource.
      This field does _not_ indicate whether the member actually has the
      permission for the resource. There might be another binding that
      overrides this binding. To determine whether the member actually has the
      permission, use the `access` field in the TroubleshootIamPolicyResponse.
    RelevanceValueValuesEnum: The relevance of this binding to the overall
      determination for the entire policy.
    RolePermissionValueValuesEnum: Indicates whether the role granted by this
      binding contains the specified permission.
    RolePermissionRelevanceValueValuesEnum: The relevance of the permission's
      existence, or nonexistence, in the role to the overall determination for
      the entire policy.

  Messages:
    MembershipsValue: Indicates whether each member in the binding includes
      the member specified in the request, either directly or indirectly. Each
      key identifies a member in the binding, and each value indicates whether
      the member in the binding includes the member in the request. For
      example, suppose that a binding includes the following members: *
      `user:alice@example.com` * `group:product-eng@example.com` You want to
      troubleshoot access for `user:bob@example.com`. This user is a member of
      the group `group:product-eng@example.com`. For the first member in the
      binding, the key is `user:alice@example.com`, and the `membership` field
      in the value is set to `MEMBERSHIP_NOT_INCLUDED`. For the second member
      in the binding, the key is `group:product-eng@example.com`, and the
      `membership` field in the value is set to `MEMBERSHIP_INCLUDED`.

  Fields:
    access: Indicates whether _this binding_ provides the specified permission
      to the specified member for the specified resource. This field does
      _not_ indicate whether the member actually has the permission for the
      resource. There might be another binding that overrides this binding. To
      determine whether the member actually has the permission, use the
      `access` field in the TroubleshootIamPolicyResponse.
    condition: A condition expression that prevents access unless the
      expression evaluates to `true`. To learn about IAM Conditions, see
      https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/overview.
    memberships: Indicates whether each member in the binding includes the
      member specified in the request, either directly or indirectly. Each key
      identifies a member in the binding, and each value indicates whether the
      member in the binding includes the member in the request. For example,
      suppose that a binding includes the following members: *
      `user:alice@example.com` * `group:product-eng@example.com` You want to
      troubleshoot access for `user:bob@example.com`. This user is a member of

      `membership` field in the value is set to `MEMBERSHIP_INCLUDED`.
    relevance: The relevance of this binding to the overall determination for
      the entire policy.
    role: The role that this binding grants. For example,
      `roles/compute.serviceAgent`. For a complete list of predefined IAM
      roles, as well as the permissions in each role, see

      the role in the binding. *
      `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address
      (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been
      recently deleted. For example, `my-other-
      app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the
      service account is undeleted, this value reverts to
      `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the
      role in the binding. * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An
      email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that
      has been recently deleted. For example,
      `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is
      recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered
      group retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:principal://iam.google
      apis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attr
      ibute_value}`: Deleted single identity in a workforce identity pool. For
      example, `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workfo
      rcePools/my-pool-id/subject/my-subject-attribute-value`.
    role: Role that is assigned to the list of `members`, or principals. For
      example, `roles/viewer`, `roles/editor`, or `roles/owner`. For an
      overview of the IAM roles and permissions, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview). For a

class GoogleIamV1Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
