class BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Action(_messages.Message):
  r"""An `Action` captures all the information about an execution which is
  required to reproduce it. `Action`s are the core component of the
  [Execution] service. A single `Action` represents a repeatable action that
  can be performed by the execution service. `Action`s can be succinctly
  identified by the digest of their wire format encoding and, once an `Action`
  has been executed, will be cached in the action cache. Future requests can
  then use the cached result rather than needing to run afresh. When a server
  completes execution of an Action, it MAY choose to cache the result in the
  ActionCache unless `do_not_cache` is `true`. Clients SHOULD expect the
  server to do so. By default, future calls to Execute the same `Action` will
  also serve their results from the cache. Clients must take care to
  understand the caching behaviour. Ideally, all `Action`s will be
  reproducible so that serving a result from cache is always desirable and
  correct.

  Fields:
    commandDigest: The digest of the Command to run, which MUST be present in
      the ContentAddressableStorage.
    doNotCache: If true, then the `Action`'s result cannot be cached, and in-
      flight requests for the same `Action` may not be merged.
    inputRootDigest: The digest of the root Directory for the input files. The
      files in the directory tree are available in the correct location on the
      build machine before the command is executed. The root directory, as
      well as every subdirectory and content blob referred to, MUST be in the
      ContentAddressableStorage.
    platform: The optional platform requirements for the execution
      environment. The server MAY choose to execute the action on any worker
      satisfying the requirements, so the client SHOULD ensure that running
      the action on any such worker will have the same result. A detailed
      lexicon for this can be found in the accompanying platform.md. New in
      version 2.2: clients SHOULD set these platform properties as well as
      those in the Command. Servers SHOULD prefer those set here.
    salt: An optional additional salt value used to place this `Action` into a
      separate cache namespace from other instances having the same field
      contents. This salt typically comes from operational configuration
      specific to sources such as repo and service configuration, and allows
      disowning an entire set of ActionResults that might have been poisoned
      by buggy software or tool failures.
    timeout: A timeout after which the execution should be killed. If the
      timeout is absent, then the client is specifying that the execution
      should continue as long as the server will let it. The server SHOULD
      impose a timeout if the client does not specify one, however, if the
      client does specify a timeout that is longer than the server's maximum
      timeout, the server MUST reject the request. The timeout is only
      intended to cover the "execution" of the specified action and not time
      in queue nor any overheads before or after execution such as marshalling
      inputs/outputs. The server SHOULD avoid including time spent the client
      doesn't have control over, and MAY extend or reduce the timeout to
      account for delays or speedups that occur during execution itself (e.g.,
      lazily loading data from the Content Addressable Storage, live migration
      of virtual machines, emulation overhead). The timeout is a part of the
      Action message, and therefore two `Actions` with different timeouts are
      different, even if they are otherwise identical. This is because, if
      they were not, running an `Action` with a lower timeout than is required
      might result in a cache hit from an execution run with a longer timeout,
      hiding the fact that the timeout is too short. By encoding it directly
      in the `Action`, a lower timeout will result in a cache miss and the
      execution timeout will fail immediately, rather than whenever the cache
      entry gets evicted.

class BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2ActionResult(_messages.Message):
  r"""An ActionResult represents the result of an Action being run. It is
  advised that at least one field (for example
  `ActionResult.execution_metadata.Worker`) have a non-default value, to
  ensure that the serialized value is non-empty, which can then be used as a
  basic data sanity check.

  Fields:
    executionMetadata: The details of the execution that originally produced
      this result.
    exitCode: The exit code of the command.
    outputDirectories: The output directories of the action. For each output
      directory requested in the `output_directories` or `output_paths` field
      of the Action, if the corresponding directory existed after the action
      completed, a single entry will be present in the output list, which will
      contain the digest of a Tree message containing the directory tree, and
      the path equal exactly to the corresponding Action output_directories
      member. As an example, suppose the Action had an output directory
      `a/b/dir` and the execution produced the following contents in
      `a/b/dir`: a file named `bar` and a directory named `foo` with an
      executable file named `baz`. Then, output_directory will contain (hashes
      shortened for readability): ```json // OutputDirectory proto: { path:
      "a/b/dir" tree_digest: { hash: "4a73bc9d03...", size: 55 } } // Tree
      proto with hash "4a73bc9d03..." and size 55: { root: { files: [ { name:
      "bar", digest: { hash: "4a73bc9d03...", size: 65534 } } ], directories:
      [ { name: "foo", digest: { hash: "4cf2eda940...", size: 43 } } ] }
      children : { // (Directory proto with hash "4cf2eda940..." and size 43)
      files: [ { name: "baz", digest: { hash: "b2c941073e...", size: 1294, },
      is_executable: true } ] } } ``` If an output of the same name as listed
      in `output_files` of the Command was found in `output_directories`, but
      was not a directory, the server will return a FAILED_PRECONDITION.
    outputDirectorySymlinks: The output directories of the action that are
      symbolic links to other directories. Those may be links to other output
      directories, or input directories, or even absolute paths outside of the
      working directory, if the server supports
      SymlinkAbsolutePathStrategy.ALLOWED. For each output directory requested
      in the `output_directories` field of the Action, if the directory
      existed after the action completed, a single entry will be present
      either in this field, or in the `output_directories` field, if the
      directory was not a symbolic link. If an output of the same name was
      found, but was a symbolic link to a file instead of a directory, the
      server will return a FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the action does not produce
      the requested output, then that output will be omitted from the list.
      The server is free to arrange the output list as desired; clients MUST
      NOT assume that the output list is sorted. DEPRECATED as of v2.1.
      Servers that wish to be compatible with v2.0 API should still populate
      this field in addition to `output_symlinks`.
    outputFileSymlinks: The output files of the action that are symbolic links
      to other files. Those may be links to other output files, or input
      files, or even absolute paths outside of the working directory, if the
      server supports SymlinkAbsolutePathStrategy.ALLOWED. For each output
      file requested in the `output_files` or `output_paths` field of the
      Action, if the corresponding file existed after the action completed, a
      single entry will be present either in this field, or in the
      `output_files` field, if the file was not a symbolic link. If an output
      symbolic link of the same name as listed in `output_files` of the
      Command was found, but its target type was not a regular file, the
      server will return a FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the action does not produce
      the requested output, then that output will be omitted from the list.
      The server is free to arrange the output list as desired; clients MUST

    outputFiles: The output files of the action. For each output file
      requested in the `output_files` or `output_paths` field of the Action,
      if the corresponding file existed after the action completed, a single
      entry will be present either in this field, or the
      `output_file_symlinks` field if the file was a symbolic link to another
      file (`output_symlinks` field after v2.1). If an output listed in
      `output_files` was found, but was a directory rather than a regular
      file, the server will return a FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the action does
      not produce the requested output, then that output will be omitted from
      the list. The server is free to arrange the output list as desired;
      clients MUST NOT assume that the output list is sorted.
    outputSymlinks: New in v2.1: this field will only be populated if the
      command `output_paths` field was used, and not the pre v2.1
      `output_files` or `output_directories` fields. The output paths of the
      action that are symbolic links to other paths. Those may be links to
      other outputs, or inputs, or even absolute paths outside of the working
      directory, if the server supports SymlinkAbsolutePathStrategy.ALLOWED. A
      single entry for each output requested in `output_paths` field of the
      Action, if the corresponding path existed after the action completed and
      was a symbolic link. If the action does not produce a requested output,
      then that output will be omitted from the list. The server is free to
      arrange the output list as desired; clients MUST NOT assume that the
      output list is sorted.
    stderrDigest: The digest for a blob containing the standard error of the
      action, which can be retrieved from the ContentAddressableStorage.
    stderrRaw: The standard error buffer of the action. The server SHOULD NOT
      inline stderr unless requested by the client in the
      GetActionResultRequest message. The server MAY omit inlining, even if
      requested, and MUST do so if inlining would cause the response to exceed
      message size limits. Clients SHOULD NOT populate this field when
      uploading to the cache.
    stdoutDigest: The digest for a blob containing the standard output of the
      action, which can be retrieved from the ContentAddressableStorage.
    stdoutRaw: The standard output buffer of the action. The server SHOULD NOT
      inline stdout unless requested by the client in the

class BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Command(_messages.Message):
  r"""A `Command` is the actual command executed by a worker running an Action
  and specifications of its environment. Except as otherwise required, the
  environment (such as which system libraries or binaries are available, and
  what filesystems are mounted where) is defined by and specific to the
  implementation of the remote execution API.

  Fields:
    arguments: The arguments to the command. The first argument specifies the
      command to run, which may be either an absolute path, a path relative to
      the working directory, or an unqualified path (without path separators)
      which will be resolved using the operating system's equivalent of the
      PATH environment variable. Path separators native to the operating
      system running on the worker SHOULD be used. If the
      `environment_variables` list contains an entry for the PATH environment
      variable, it SHOULD be respected. If not, the resolution process is
      implementation-defined. Changed in v2.3. v2.2 and older require that no
      PATH lookups are performed, and that relative paths are resolved
      relative to the input root. This behavior can, however, not be relied
      upon, as most implementations already followed the rules described
      above.
    environmentVariables: The environment variables to set when running the
      program. The worker may provide its own default environment variables;
      these defaults can be overridden using this field. Additional variables
      can also be specified. In order to ensure that equivalent Commands
      always hash to the same value, the environment variables MUST be
      lexicographically sorted by name. Sorting of strings is done by code
      point, equivalently, by the UTF-8 bytes.
    outputDirectories: A list of the output directories that the client
      expects to retrieve from the action. Only the listed directories will be
      returned (an entire directory structure will be returned as a Tree
      message digest, see OutputDirectory), as well as files listed in
      `output_files`. Other files or directories that may be created during
      command execution are discarded. The paths are relative to the working
      directory of the action execution. The paths are specified using a
      single forward slash (`/`) as a path separator, even if the execution
      platform natively uses a different separator. The path MUST NOT include
      a trailing slash, nor a leading slash, being a relative path. The
      special value of empty string is allowed, although not recommended, and
      can be used to capture the entire working directory tree, including
      inputs. In order to ensure consistent hashing of the same Action, the
      output paths MUST be sorted lexicographically by code point (or,
      equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes). An output directory cannot be duplicated
      or have the same path as any of the listed output files. An output
      directory is allowed to be a parent of another output directory.
      Directories leading up to the output directories (but not the output
      directories themselves) are created by the worker prior to execution,
      even if they are not explicitly part of the input root. DEPRECATED since
      2.1: Use `output_paths` instead.
    outputFiles: A list of the output files that the client expects to
      retrieve from the action. Only the listed files, as well as directories
      listed in `output_directories`, will be returned to the client as
      output. Other files or directories that may be created during command
      execution are discarded. The paths are relative to the working directory
      of the action execution. The paths are specified using a single forward
      slash (`/`) as a path separator, even if the execution platform natively
      uses a different separator. The path MUST NOT include a trailing slash,
      nor a leading slash, being a relative path. In order to ensure
      consistent hashing of the same Action, the output paths MUST be sorted
      lexicographically by code point (or, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes). An
      output file cannot be duplicated, be a parent of another output file, or
      have the same path as any of the listed output directories. Directories
      leading up to the output files are created by the worker prior to
      execution, even if they are not explicitly part of the input root.
      DEPRECATED since v2.1: Use `output_paths` instead.
    outputNodeProperties: A list of keys for node properties the client
      expects to retrieve for output files and directories. Keys are either
      names of string-based NodeProperty or names of fields in NodeProperties.
      In order to ensure that equivalent `Action`s always hash to the same
      value, the node properties MUST be lexicographically sorted by name.
      Sorting of strings is done by code point, equivalently, by the UTF-8
      bytes. The interpretation of string-based properties is server-
      dependent. If a property is not recognized by the server, the server
      will return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
    outputPaths: A list of the output paths that the client expects to
      retrieve from the action. Only the listed paths will be returned to the
      client as output. The type of the output (file or directory) is not
      specified, and will be determined by the server after action execution.
      If the resulting path is a file, it will be returned in an OutputFile
      typed field. If the path is a directory, the entire directory structure
      will be returned as a Tree message digest, see OutputDirectory Other
      files or directories that may be created during command execution are
      discarded. The paths are relative to the working directory of the action
      execution. The paths are specified using a single forward slash (`/`) as
      a path separator, even if the execution platform natively uses a
      different separator. The path MUST NOT include a trailing slash, nor a
      leading slash, being a relative path. In order to ensure consistent
      hashing of the same Action, the output paths MUST be deduplicated and
      sorted lexicographically by code point (or, equivalently, by UTF-8
      bytes). Directories leading up to the output paths are created by the
      worker prior to execution, even if they are not explicitly part of the
      input root. New in v2.1: this field supersedes the DEPRECATED
      `output_files` and `output_directories` fields. If `output_paths` is
      used, `output_files` and `output_directories` will be ignored!
    platform: The platform requirements for the execution environment. The
      server MAY choose to execute the action on any worker satisfying the
      requirements, so the client SHOULD ensure that running the action on any
      such worker will have the same result. A detailed lexicon for this can
      be found in the accompanying platform.md. DEPRECATED as of v2.2:
      platform properties are now specified directly in the action. See
      documentation note in the Action for migration.
    workingDirectory: The working directory, relative to the input root, for
      the command to run in. It must be a directory which exists in the input
      tree. If it is left empty, then the action is run in the input root.

class BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Digest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A content digest. A digest for a given blob consists of the size of the
  blob and its hash. The hash algorithm to use is defined by the server. The
  size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be
  separated. That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but
  `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request. The reason for
  including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great many cases, the
  server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work with prior to
  starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree structures or
  streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could implement a separate
  metadata store, but this results in a significantly more complicated
  implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size up-front (or
  storing the size along with the digest in every message where digests are
  embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation details of
  (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but we consider
  this to be a worthwhile tradeoff. When a `Digest` is used to refer to a
  proto message, it always refers to the message in binary encoded form. To
  ensure consistent hashing, clients and servers MUST ensure that they
  serialize messages according to the following rules, even if there are
  alternate valid encodings for the same message: * Fields are serialized in
  tag order. * There are no unknown fields. * There are no duplicate fields. *
  Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type.
  Most protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when
  serializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance,
  concatenating two messages to merge them may produce duplicate fields.

  Fields:
    hash: The hash. In the case of SHA-256, it will always be a lowercase hex

  possibly some metadata about the file or directory. In order to ensure that
  two equivalent directory trees hash to the same value, the following
  restrictions MUST be obeyed when constructing a a `Directory`: * Every child
  in the directory must have a path of exactly one segment. Multiple levels of
  directory hierarchy may not be collapsed. * Each child in the directory must
  have a unique path segment (file name). Note that while the API itself is
  case-sensitive, the environment where the Action is executed may or may not

      stored in topological order, with parents being stored before the child.
      The root directory is thus the first to be stored. Additionally, the

      it is only permitted to store data associated with field numbers 1 and

      files) from those that don't (eg, standard header files).
    inlineBlobs: Inline contents for blobs expected to be needed by the bot to
      execute the task. For example, contents of entries in `files` or blobs
      that are indirectly referenced by an entry there. The bot should check
      against this list before downloading required task inputs to reduce the
      number of communications between itself and the remote CAS server.
    workingDirectory: Directory from which a command is executed. It is a
      relative directory with respect to the bot's working directory (i.e.,
      "./"). If it is non-empty, then it must exist under "./". Otherwise,
      "./" will be used.
