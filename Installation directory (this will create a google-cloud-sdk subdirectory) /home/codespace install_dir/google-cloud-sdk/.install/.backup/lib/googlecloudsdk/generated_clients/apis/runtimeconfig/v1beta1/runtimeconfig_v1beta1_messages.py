class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    rules: If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the
      following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any
      DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied. Logging will be
      applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if
      any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is granted. Logging
      will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. -
      Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-

  variables).

  Fields:
    name: The name of the variable resource, in the format:

      The `[PROJECT_ID]` must be a valid project ID, `[CONFIG_NAME]` must be a
      valid RuntimeConfig resource and `[VARIABLE_NAME]` follows Unix file
      system file path naming. The `[VARIABLE_NAME]` can contain ASCII
      letters, numbers, slashes and dashes. Slashes are used as path element
      separators and are not part of the `[VARIABLE_NAME]` itself, so
      `[VARIABLE_NAME]` must contain at least one non-slash character.
      Multiple slashes are coalesced into single slash character. Each path
      segment should match [0-9A-Za-z](?:[_.A-Za-z0-9-]{0,62}[_.A-Za-z0-9])?

      `text: "my text value"`. The string must be valid UTF-8.
    updateTime: Output only. The time of the last variable update. Timestamp
      will be UTC timestamp.
    value: The binary value of the variable. The length of the value must be
      less than 4096 bytes. Empty values are also accepted. The value must be
      base64 encoded, and must comply with IETF RFC4648

  Waiter resource with the success condition set to wait until some number of
  nodes have checked in. Afterwards, your application runs some arbitrary code
  after the condition has been met and the waiter returns successfully. Once
  created, a Waiter resource is immutable. To learn more about using waiters,
  read the [Creating a Waiter](/deployment-manager/runtime-
  configurator/creating-a-waiter) documentation.

  Fields:
    createTime: Output only. The instant at which this Waiter resource was
      created. Adding the value of `timeout` to this instant yields the
      timeout deadline for the waiter.
    done: Output only. If the value is `false`, it means the waiter is still
      waiting for one of its conditions to be met. If true, the waiter has
      finished. If the waiter finished due to a timeout or failure, `error`
      will be set.
    error: Output only. If the waiter ended due to a failure or timeout, this
      value will be set.
    failure: [Optional] The failure condition of this waiter. If this
      condition is met, `done` will be set to `true` and the `error` code will
      be set to `ABORTED`. The failure condition takes precedence over the
      success condition. If both conditions are met, a failure will be
      indicated. This value is optional; if no failure condition is set, the
      only failure scenario will be a timeout.
    name: The name of the Waiter resource, in the format:
      projects/[PROJECT_ID]/configs/[CONFIG_NAME]/waiters/[WAITER_NAME] The
      `[PROJECT_ID]` must be a valid Google Cloud project ID, the
      `[CONFIG_NAME]` must be a valid RuntimeConfig resource, the
      `[WAITER_NAME]` must match RFC 1035 segment specification, and the
      length of `[WAITER_NAME]` must be less than 64 bytes. After you create a
      Waiter resource, you cannot change the resource name.
    success: [Required] The success condition. If this condition is met,
      `done` will be set to `true` and the `error` value will remain unset.
      The failure condition takes precedence over the success condition. If
      both conditions are met, a failure will be indicated.
    timeout: [Required] Specifies the timeout of the waiter in seconds,
      beginning from the instant that `waiters().create` method is called. If
