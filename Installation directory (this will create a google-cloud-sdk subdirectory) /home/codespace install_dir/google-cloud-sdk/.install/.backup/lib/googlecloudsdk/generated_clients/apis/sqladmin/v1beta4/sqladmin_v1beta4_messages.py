      For example, for the pair `ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY` and

      connections, while the `require_ssl=false` means accept both non-SSL and

      name must comply with [RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035).

      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?.`
    authorizedNetworks: The list of external networks that are allowed to
      connect to the instance using the IP. In 'CIDR' notation, also known as
      'slash' notation (for example: `157.197.200.0/24`).

    privateNetwork: The resource link for the VPC network from which the Cloud

      `/projects/myProject/global/networks/default`. This setting can be
      updated, but it cannot be removed after it is set.
    pscConfig: PSC settings for this instance.
    requireSsl: Use `ssl_mode` instead for MySQL and PostgreSQL. SQL Server
      uses this flag. Whether SSL/TLS connections over IP are enforced. If set
      to false, then allow both non-SSL/non-TLS and SSL/TLS connections. For
      SSL/TLS connections, the client certificate won't be verified. If set to
      true, then only allow connections encrypted with SSL/TLS and with valid
      client certificates. If you want to enforce SSL/TLS without enforcing
      the requirement for valid client certificates, then use the `ssl_mode`
      flag instead of the legacy `require_ssl` flag.
