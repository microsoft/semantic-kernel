class Bucket(_messages.Message):
  r"""A bucket.

  Messages:
    AutoclassValue: The bucket's Autoclass configuration.
    BillingValue: The bucket's billing configuration.
    CorsValueListEntry: A CorsValueListEntry object.
    CustomPlacementConfigValue: The bucket's custom placement configuration
      for Custom Dual Regions.
    EncryptionValue: Encryption configuration for a bucket.
    HierarchicalNamespaceValue: The bucket's hierarchical namespace
      configuration.
    IamConfigurationValue: The bucket's IAM configuration.
    LabelsValue: User-provided labels, in key/value pairs.
    LifecycleValue: The bucket's lifecycle configuration. See lifecycle
      management for more information.
    LoggingValue: The bucket's logging configuration, which defines the
      destination bucket and optional name prefix for the current bucket's
      logs.
    ObjectRetentionValue: The bucket's object retention config.
    OwnerValue: The owner of the bucket. This is always the project team's
      owner group.
    RetentionPolicyValue: The bucket's retention policy. The retention policy
      enforces a minimum retention time for all objects contained in the
      bucket, based on their creation time. Any attempt to overwrite or delete
      objects younger than the retention period will result in a
      PERMISSION_DENIED error. An unlocked retention policy can be modified or
      removed from the bucket via a storage.buckets.update operation. A locked
      retention policy cannot be removed or shortened in duration for the
      lifetime of the bucket. Attempting to remove or decrease period of a
      locked retention policy will result in a PERMISSION_DENIED error.
    SoftDeletePolicyValue: The bucket's soft delete policy, which defines the
      period of time that soft-deleted objects will be retained, and cannot be
      permanently deleted.
    VersioningValue: The bucket's versioning configuration.
    WebsiteValue: The bucket's website configuration, controlling how the
      service behaves when accessing bucket contents as a web site. See the
      Static Website Examples for more information.

  Fields:
    acl: Access controls on the bucket.
    autoclass: The bucket's Autoclass configuration.
    billing: The bucket's billing configuration.
    cors: The bucket's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration.
    customPlacementConfig: The bucket's custom placement configuration for
      Custom Dual Regions.
    defaultEventBasedHold: The default value for event-based hold on newly
      created objects in this bucket. Event-based hold is a way to retain
      objects indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the hold's
      release. After being released, such objects will be subject to bucket-
      level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks
      to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full.
      Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid
      in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any
      number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the
      object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means
      retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based
      hold transitioned from true to false. Objects under event-based hold
      cannot be deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed.
    defaultObjectAcl: Default access controls to apply to new objects when no
      ACL is provided.
    encryption: Encryption configuration for a bucket.
    etag: HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the bucket.
    hierarchicalNamespace: The bucket's hierarchical namespace configuration.
    iamConfiguration: The bucket's IAM configuration.
    id: The ID of the bucket. For buckets, the id and name properties are the
      same.
    kind: The kind of item this is. For buckets, this is always
      storage#bucket.
    labels: User-provided labels, in key/value pairs.
    lifecycle: The bucket's lifecycle configuration. See lifecycle management
      for more information.
    location: The location of the bucket. Object data for objects in the
      bucket resides in physical storage within this region. Defaults to US.
      See the developer's guide for the authoritative list.
    locationType: The type of the bucket location.
    logging: The bucket's logging configuration, which defines the destination
      bucket and optional name prefix for the current bucket's logs.
    metageneration: The metadata generation of this bucket.
    name: The name of the bucket.
    objectRetention: The bucket's object retention config.
    owner: The owner of the bucket. This is always the project team's owner
      group.
    projectNumber: The project number of the project the bucket belongs to.
    retentionPolicy: The bucket's retention policy. The retention policy
      enforces a minimum retention time for all objects contained in the
      bucket, based on their creation time. Any attempt to overwrite or delete
      objects younger than the retention period will result in a
      PERMISSION_DENIED error. An unlocked retention policy can be modified or
      removed from the bucket via a storage.buckets.update operation. A locked
      retention policy cannot be removed or shortened in duration for the
      lifetime of the bucket. Attempting to remove or decrease period of a
      locked retention policy will result in a PERMISSION_DENIED error.
    rpo: The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of this bucket. Set to ASYNC_TURBO
      to turn on Turbo Replication on a bucket.
    satisfiesPZS: Reserved for future use.
    selfLink: The URI of this bucket.
    softDeletePolicy: The bucket's soft delete policy, which defines the
      period of time that soft-deleted objects will be retained, and cannot be
      permanently deleted.
    storageClass: The bucket's default storage class, used whenever no
      storageClass is specified for a newly-created object. This defines how
      objects in the bucket are stored and determines the SLA and the cost of
      storage. Values include MULTI_REGIONAL, REGIONAL, STANDARD, NEARLINE,
      COLDLINE, ARCHIVE, and DURABLE_REDUCED_AVAILABILITY. If this value is
      not specified when the bucket is created, it will default to STANDARD.
      For more information, see storage classes.
    timeCreated: The creation time of the bucket in RFC 3339 format.
    updated: The modification time of the bucket in RFC 3339 format.
    versioning: The bucket's versioning configuration.
    website: The bucket's website configuration, controlling how the service

  Messages:
    CustomerEncryptionValue: Metadata of customer-supplied encryption key, if
      the object is encrypted by such a key.
    MetadataValue: User-provided metadata, in key/value pairs.
    OwnerValue: The owner of the object. This will always be the uploader of
      the object.
    RetentionValue: A collection of object level retention parameters.

  Fields:
    acl: Access controls on the object.
    bucket: The name of the bucket containing this object.
    cacheControl: Cache-Control directive for the object data. If omitted, and
      the object is accessible to all anonymous users, the default will be
      public, max-age=3600.
    componentCount: Number of underlying components that make up this object.
      Components are accumulated by compose operations.
    contentDisposition: Content-Disposition of the object data.
    contentEncoding: Content-Encoding of the object data.
    contentLanguage: Content-Language of the object data.
    contentType: Content-Type of the object data. If an object is stored
      without a Content-Type, it is served as application/octet-stream.
    crc32c: CRC32c checksum, as described in RFC 4960, Appendix B; encoded
      using base64 in big-endian byte order. For more information about using
      the CRC32c checksum, see Hashes and ETags: Best Practices.
    customTime: A timestamp in RFC 3339 format specified by the user for an
      object.
    customerEncryption: Metadata of customer-supplied encryption key, if the
      object is encrypted by such a key.
    etag: HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the object.
    eventBasedHold: Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based
      hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is
      signified by the hold's release (i.e. this value is set to false). After
      being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-
      level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks
      to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full.
      Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being
      paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any
      number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the
      object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means
      retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based
      hold transitioned from true to false.
    generation: The content generation of this object. Used for object
      versioning.
    hardDeleteTime: This is the time (in the future) when the soft-deleted
      object will no longer be restorable. It is equal to the soft delete time
      plus the current soft delete retention duration of the bucket.
    id: The ID of the object, including the bucket name, object name, and
      generation number.
    kind: The kind of item this is. For objects, this is always
      storage#object.
    kmsKeyName: Not currently supported. Specifying the parameter causes the
      request to fail with status code 400 - Bad Request.
    md5Hash: MD5 hash of the data; encoded using base64. For more information
      about using the MD5 hash, see Hashes and ETags: Best Practices.
    mediaLink: Media download link.
    metadata: User-provided metadata, in key/value pairs.
    metageneration: The version of the metadata for this object at this
      generation. Used for preconditions and for detecting changes in
      metadata. A metageneration number is only meaningful in the context of a
      particular generation of a particular object.
    name: The name of the object. Required if not specified by URL parameter.
    owner: The owner of the object. This will always be the uploader of the
      object.
    retention: A collection of object level retention parameters.
    retentionExpirationTime: A server-determined value that specifies the
      earliest time that the object's retention period expires. This value is
      in RFC 3339 format. Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with
      an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until
      the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when
      temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without
      having to first unset the temporary hold).
    selfLink: The link to this object.
    size: Content-Length of the data in bytes.
    softDeleteTime: The time at which the object became soft-deleted in RFC
      3339 format.
    storageClass: Storage class of the object.
    temporaryHold: Whether an object is under temporary hold. While this flag
      is set to true, the object is protected against deletion and overwrites.
      A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where
      objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note
      that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention
      expiration time of an object.
    timeCreated: The creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format.
    timeDeleted: The time at which the object became noncurrent in RFC 3339
      format. Will be returned if and only if this version of the object has
      been deleted.
    timeStorageClassUpdated: The time at which the object's storage class was
      last changed. When the object is initially created, it will be set to
      timeCreated.
    updated: The modification time of the object metadata in RFC 3339 format.
      Set initially to object creation time and then updated whenever any
      metadata of the object changes. This includes changes made by a
      requester, such as modifying custom metadata, as well as changes made by
      Cloud Storage on behalf of a requester, such as changing the storage
      class based on an Object Lifecycle Configuration.

    bucket: Name of the bucket in which to look for objects.
    channel: A Channel resource to be passed as the request body.
    delimiter: Returns results in a directory-like mode. items will contain
      only objects whose names, aside from the prefix, do not contain
      delimiter. Objects whose names, aside from the prefix, contain delimiter
      will have their name, truncated after the delimiter, returned in
      prefixes. Duplicate prefixes are omitted.
    endOffset: Filter results to objects whose names are lexicographically
      before endOffset. If startOffset is also set, the objects listed will
      have names between startOffset (inclusive) and endOffset (exclusive).
    includeTrailingDelimiter: If true, objects that end in exactly one
      instance of delimiter will have their metadata included in items in
      addition to prefixes.
    maxResults: Maximum number of items plus prefixes to return in a single
      page of responses. As duplicate prefixes are omitted, fewer total
      results may be returned than requested. The service will use this
      parameter or 1,000 items, whichever is smaller.
    pageToken: A previously-returned page token representing part of the
      larger set of results to view.
    prefix: Filter results to objects whose names begin with this prefix.
    projection: Set of properties to return. Defaults to noAcl.
    startOffset: Filter results to objects whose names are lexicographically
      equal to or after startOffset. If endOffset is also set, the objects
      listed will have names between startOffset (inclusive) and endOffset
      (exclusive).
    userProject: The project to be billed for this request. Required for
      Requester Pays buckets.
    versions: If true, lists all versions of an object as distinct results.
      The default is false. For more information, see Object Versioning.
