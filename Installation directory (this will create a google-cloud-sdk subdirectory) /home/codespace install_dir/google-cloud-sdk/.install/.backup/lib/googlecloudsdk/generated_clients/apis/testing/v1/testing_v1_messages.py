  Fields:
    targetedShardDuration: The amount of time tests within a shard should

      (2 minutes). The shard count is dynamically set based on time, up to the
      maximum shard limit (described below). To guarantee at least one test
      case for each shard, the number of shards will not exceed the number of
      test cases. Shard duration will be exceeded if: - The maximum shard
      limit is reached and there is more calculated test time remaining to
      allocate into shards. - Any individual test is estimated to be longer
      than the targeted shard duration. Shard duration is not guaranteed
      because smart sharding uses test case history and default durations
      which may not be accurate. The rules for finding the test case timing
      records are: - If the service has processed a test case in the last 30
      days, the record of the latest successful test case will be used. - For
      new test cases, the average duration of other known test cases will be
      used. - If there are no previous test case timing records available, the
      default test case duration is 15 seconds. Because the actual shard
      duration can exceed the targeted shard duration, we recommend that you
      set the targeted value at least 5 minutes less than the maximum allowed
      test timeout (45 minutes for physical devices and 60 minutes for
      virtual), or that you use the custom test timeout value that you set.
      This approach avoids cancelling the shard before all tests can finish.
      Note that there is a limit for maximum number of shards. When you select
      one or more physical devices, the number of shards must be <= 50. When
      you select one or more ARM virtual devices, it must be <= 200. When you
      select only x86 virtual devices, it must be <= 500. To guarantee at
      least one test case for per shard, the number of shards will not exceed
      the number of test cases. Each shard created counts toward daily test
