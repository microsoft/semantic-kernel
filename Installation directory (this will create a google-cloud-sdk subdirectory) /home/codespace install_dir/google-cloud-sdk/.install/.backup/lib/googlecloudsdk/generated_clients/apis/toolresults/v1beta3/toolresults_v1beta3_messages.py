class Any(_messages.Message):
  r""" `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
  with a URL that describes the type of the serialized message. Protobuf
  library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility
  functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack
  and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ...
  if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in
  Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in
  Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if
  any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a
  message in Go foo := &pb.Foo{...} any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo) ... foo
  := &pb.Foo{} if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil { ... } The
  pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack methods
  only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/' in the type URL,
  for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type name "y.z". # JSON The JSON
  representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the
  deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which
  contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person {
  string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { "@type":
  "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person", "firstName": , "lastName": } If
  the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value`
  which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for
  message google.protobuf.Duration): { "@type":
  "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration", "value": "1.212s" }

  Fields:
    typeUrl: A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
      serialized protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent the
      fully qualified name of the type (as in
      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually
      precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the
      context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`,
      or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type
      URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided,
      `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
      google.protobuf.Type value in binary format, or produce an error. *
      Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or
      have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore,
      binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use
      versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this
      functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf
      release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
      type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
      scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics.

  step can be used to represent the execution of a tool ( for example a test

  instance two steps might have the same start time if some operations are
  done in parallel). Here is an example, let's consider that we have a
  continuous build is executing a test runner for each iteration. The workflow
  would look like: - user creates a Execution with id 1 - user creates a
  TestExecutionStep with id 100 for Execution 1 - user update
  TestExecutionStep with id 100 to add a raw xml log + the service parses the
  xml logs and returns a TestExecutionStep with updated TestResult(s). - user
  update the status of TestExecutionStep with id 100 to COMPLETE A Step can be
  updated until its state is set to COMPLETE at which points it becomes
  immutable.

  Enums:
    StateValueValuesEnum: The initial state is IN_PROGRESS. The only legal
      state transitions are * IN_PROGRESS -> COMPLETE A PRECONDITION_FAILED
      will be returned if an invalid transition is requested. It is valid to
      create Step with a state set to COMPLETE. The state can only be set to

      create/update request: optional

  Fields:

      value will be set automatically when state transitions to COMPLETE. - In

      request: never set
    creationTime: The time when the step was created. - In response: always

      In create/update request: optional
    deviceUsageDuration: How much the device resource is used to perform the
      test. This is the device usage used for billing purpose, which is
      different from the run_duration, for example, infrastructure failure
      won't be charged for device usage. PRECONDITION_FAILED will be returned
      if one attempts to set a device_usage on a step which already has this
      field set. - In response: present if previously set. - In create
      request: optional - In update request: optional
    dimensionValue: If the execution containing this step has any
      dimension_definition set, then this field allows the child to specify
      the values of the dimensions. The keys must exactly match the
      dimension_definition of the execution. For example, if the execution has
      `dimension_definition = ['attempt', 'device']` then a step must define
      values for those dimensions, eg. `dimension_value = ['attempt': '1',
      'device': 'Nexus 6']` If a step does not participate in one dimension of
      the matrix, the value for that dimension should be empty string. For
      example, if one of the tests is executed by a runner which does not
      support retries, the step could have `dimension_value = ['attempt': '',
      'device': 'Nexus 6']` If the step does not participate in any dimensions
      of the matrix, it may leave dimension_value unset. A PRECONDITION_FAILED
      will be returned if any of the keys do not exist in the
      dimension_definition of the execution. A PRECONDITION_FAILED will be
      returned if another step in this execution already has the same name and
      dimension_value, but differs on other data fields, for example, step
      field is different. A PRECONDITION_FAILED will be returned if
      dimension_value is set, and there is a dimension_definition in the
      execution which is not specified as one of the keys. - In response:

    labels: Arbitrary user-supplied key/value pairs that are associated with
      the step. Users are responsible for managing the key namespace such that
      keys don't accidentally collide. An INVALID_ARGUMENT will be returned if
      the number of labels exceeds 100 or if the length of any of the keys or
      values exceeds 100 characters. - In response: always set - In create
      request: optional - In update request: optional; any new key/value pair
      will be added to the map, and any new value for an existing key will
      update that key's value
    multiStep: Details when multiple steps are run with the same configuration
      as a group. These details can be used identify which group this step is
      part of. It also identifies the groups 'primary step' which indexes all
      the group members. - In response: present if previously set. - In create

      update request: optional
    name: A short human-readable name to display in the UI. Maximum of 100
      characters. For example: Clean build A PRECONDITION_FAILED will be
      returned upon creating a new step if it shares its name and
      dimension_value with an existing step. If two steps represent a similar
      action, but have different dimension values, they should share the same
      name. For instance, if the same set of tests is run on two different
      platforms, the two steps should have the same name. - In response:
      always set - In create request: always set - In update request: never
      set
    outcome: Classification of the result, for example into SUCCESS or FAILURE
      - In response: present if set by create/update request - In
      create/update request: optional
    runDuration: How long it took for this step to run. If unset, this is set
      to the difference between creation_time and completion_time when the
      step is set to the COMPLETE state. In some cases, it is appropriate to
      set this value separately: For instance, if a step is created, but the
      operation it represents is queued for a few minutes before it executes,
      it would be appropriate not to include the time spent queued in its
      run_duration. PRECONDITION_FAILED will be returned if one attempts to
      set a run_duration on a step which already has this field set. - In
      response: present if previously set; always present on COMPLETE step -
      In create request: optional - In update request: optional
    state: The initial state is IN_PROGRESS. The only legal state transitions
      are * IN_PROGRESS -> COMPLETE A PRECONDITION_FAILED will be returned if
      an invalid transition is requested. It is valid to create Step with a
      state set to COMPLETE. The state can only be set to COMPLETE once. A
