  `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little
  work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript.
  This reference page doesn't have information about the absolute color space
  that should be used to interpret the RGB value-for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB,
  DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color
  space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless
  documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green,
  blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import
  com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color
  protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ?
  protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color(

      That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color

      message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to

    confidence: **Deprecated. Use `score` instead.** The accuracy of the
      entity detection in an image. For example, for an image in which the
      "Eiffel Tower" entity is detected, this field represents the confidence
      that there is a tower in the query image. Range [0, 1].
    description: Entity textual description, expressed in its `locale`

    locale: The language code for the locale in which the entity textual
      `description` is expressed.
    locations: The location information for the detected entity. Multiple
      `LocationInfo` elements can be present because one location may indicate
      the location of the scene in the image, and another location may
      indicate the location of the place where the image was taken. Location

    score: Overall score of the result. Range [0, 1].
    topicality: The relevancy of the ICA (Image Content Annotation) label to
      the image. For example, the relevancy of "tower" is likely higher to an
      image containing the detected "Eiffel Tower" than to an image containing
      a detected distant towering building, even though the confidence that

      is based on the landmarker results. Note that one or more x and/or y

      the `boundingPoly`, and encloses only the skin part of the face.
      Typically, it is used to eliminate the face from any image analysis that
      detects the "amount of skin" visible in an image. It is not based on the
      landmarker results, only on the initial face detection, hence the fd

      by the `product-set-id` and `product-id` values does not exist, then the

      this case, the `product-display-name` column refers to display_name, the
      `product-category` column refers to product_category, and the `labels`
      column refers to product_labels. The `image-id` column is optional but
      must be unique if provided. If it is empty, the system will
      automatically assign a unique id to the image. The `product-display-
      name` column is optional. If it is empty, the system sets the
      display_name field for the product to a space (" "). You can update the
      `display_name` later by using the API. If a `Product` with the specified
      `product-id` already exists, then the system ignores the `product-
      display-name`, `product-category`, and `labels` columns. The `labels`
      column (optional) is a line containing a list of comma-separated key-
      value pairs, in the following format:
      "key_1=value_1,key_2=value_2,...,key_n=value_n" The `bounding-poly`

      interest automatically. At most one `bounding-poly` column is allowed
      per line. If the image contains multiple regions of interest, add a line
      to the CSV file that includes the same product information, and the
      `bounding-poly` values for each region of interest. The `bounding-poly`
      column must contain an even number of comma-separated numbers, in the
      format "p1_x,p1_y,p2_x,p2_y,...,pn_x,pn_y". Use non-negative integers
      for absolute bounding polygons, and float values in [0, 1] for
