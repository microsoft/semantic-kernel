  connectionPersistenceOnUnhealthyBackends:
    description: |-
      Specifies connection persistence when backends are unhealthy. The default
      value is DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL. If set to DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL, the
      existing connections persist on unhealthy backends only for connection-
      oriented protocols (TCP and SCTP) and only if the Tracking Mode is
      PER_CONNECTION (default tracking mode) or the Session Affinity is
      configured for 5-tuple. They do not persist for UDP. If set to
      NEVER_PERSIST, after a backend becomes unhealthy, the existing connections
      on the unhealthy backend are never persisted on the unhealthy backend.
      They are always diverted to newly selected healthy backends (unless all
      backends are unhealthy). If set to ALWAYS_PERSIST, existing connections
      always persist on unhealthy backends regardless of protocol and session
      affinity. It is generally not recommended to use this mode overriding the
      default. For more details, see [Connection Persistence for Network Load
      Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/network/networklb-backend-service#connection-persistence)
      and [Connection Persistence for Internal TCP/UDP Load
      Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/internal#connection-persistence).

  enableStrongAffinity:
    description: |-
      Enable Strong Session Affinity for external passthrough Network Load
      Balancers. This option is not available publicly.
    type: boolean
  idleTimeoutSec:
    description: |-
      Specifies how long to keep a Connection Tracking entry while there is no
      matching traffic (in seconds). For internal passthrough Network Load
      Balancers: - The minimum (default) is 10 minutes and the maximum is 16
      hours. - It can be set only if Connection Tracking is less than 5-tuple
      (i.e. Session Affinity is CLIENT_IP_NO_DESTINATION, CLIENT_IP or
      CLIENT_IP_PROTO, and Tracking Mode is PER_SESSION). For external
      passthrough Network Load Balancers the default is 60 seconds. This option
      is not available publicly.
    type: integer
  trackingMode:
    description: |-
      Specifies the key used for connection tracking. There are two options: -
      PER_CONNECTION: This is the default mode. The Connection Tracking is
      performed as per the Connection Key (default Hash Method) for the specific
      protocol. - PER_SESSION: The Connection Tracking is performed as per the
      configured Session Affinity. It matches the configured Session Affinity.
      For more details, see [Tracking Mode for Network Load
      Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/network/networklb-backend-service#tracking-mode) and
      [Tracking Mode for Internal TCP/UDP Load
      Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/internal#tracking-mode).
