      If true, indicates that the BackendServices referenced by the urlMap may
      be accessed by gRPC applications without using a sidecar proxy. This will
      enable configuration checks on urlMap and its referenced BackendServices
      to not allow unsupported features. A gRPC application must use "xds:///"
      scheme in the target URI of the service it is connecting to. If false,
      indicates that the BackendServices referenced by the urlMap will be
      accessed by gRPC applications via a sidecar proxy. In this case, a gRPC
      application must not use "xds:///" scheme in the target URI of the service
      it is connecting to
