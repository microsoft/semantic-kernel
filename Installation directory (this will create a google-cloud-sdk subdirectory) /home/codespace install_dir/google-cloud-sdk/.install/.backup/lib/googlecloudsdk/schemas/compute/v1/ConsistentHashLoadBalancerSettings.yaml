      Hash is based on HTTP Cookie. This field describes a HTTP cookie that will
      be used as the hash key for the consistent hash load balancer. If the

      the sessionAffinity is set to HTTP_COOKIE. Not supported when the backend
      service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that
      has validateForProxyless field set to true.

  minimumRingSize:

      The minimum number of virtual nodes to use for the hash ring. Defaults to
      1024. Larger ring sizes result in more granular load distributions. If the
      number of hosts in the load balancing pool is larger than the ring size,
      each host will be assigned a single virtual node.
