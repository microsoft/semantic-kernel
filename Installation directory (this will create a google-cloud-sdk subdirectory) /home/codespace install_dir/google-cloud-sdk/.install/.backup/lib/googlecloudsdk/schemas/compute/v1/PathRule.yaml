      The list of path patterns to match. Each must start with / and the only
      place a * is allowed is at the end following a /. The string fed to the
      path matcher does not include any text after the first ? or #, and those
      chars are not allowed here.

  routeAction:
    description: |-
      In response to a matching path, the load balancer performs advanced
      routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header transformations,
      before forwarding the request to the selected backend. If routeAction
      specifies any weightedBackendServices, service must not be set.
      Conversely if service is set, routeAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Only one of routeAction or urlRedirect must
      be set. URL maps for Classic external HTTP(S) load balancers only
      support the urlRewrite action within a path rule's routeAction.
    $ref: HttpRouteAction.yaml
  service:
    description: |-
      The full or partial URL of the backend service resource to which
      traffic is directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is also
      specified, advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites, take effect
      before sending the request to the backend. However, if service is
      specified, routeAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.
      Conversely, if routeAction specifies any weightedBackendServices,
      service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect, service or
      routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
    type: string
  urlRedirect:
    description: |-
      When a path pattern is matched, the request is redirected to a URL
      specified by urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service or
      routeAction must not be set. Not supported when the URL map is bound
      to a target gRPC proxy.
