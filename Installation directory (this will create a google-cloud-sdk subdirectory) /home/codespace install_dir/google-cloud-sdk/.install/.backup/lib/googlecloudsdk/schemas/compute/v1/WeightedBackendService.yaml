  backendService:
    description: |-
      The full or partial URL to the default BackendService resource. Before
      forwarding the request to backendService, the load balancer applies any
      relevant headerActions specified as part of this backendServiceWeight.

  headerAction:
    description: |-
      Specifies changes to request and response headers that need to take effect
      for the selected backendService. headerAction specified here take effect
      before headerAction in the enclosing HttpRouteRule, PathMatcher and
      UrlMap. headerAction is not supported for load balancers that have their
      loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL. Not supported when the URL map is
      bound to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to
      true.

  weight:
    description: |-
      Specifies the fraction of traffic sent to a backend service, computed as
      weight / (sum of all weightedBackendService weights in routeAction) . The
      selection of a backend service is determined only for new traffic. Once a
      user's request has been directed to a backend service, subsequent requests
      are sent to the same backend service as determined by the backend
      service's session affinity policy. The value must be from 0 to 1000.
