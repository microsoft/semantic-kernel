  allowOpen:

      Determines if server allows plaintext connections. If set to true, server
      allows plain text connections. By default, it is set to false. This
      setting is not exclusive of other encryption modes. For example, if
      `allow_open` and `mtls_policy` are set, server allows both plain text and
      mTLS connections. See documentation of other encryption modes to confirm
      compatibility. Consider using it if you wish to upgrade in place your
      deployment to TLS while having mixed TLS and non-TLS traffic reaching port
      :80.

      Defines a mechanism to provision peer validation certificates for peer to
      peer authentication (Mutual TLS - mTLS). If not specified, client
      certificate will not be requested. The connection is treated as TLS and
      not mTLS. If `allow_open` and `mtls_policy` are set, server allows both
      plain text and mTLS connections.

  serverCertificate:

      Defines a mechanism to provision server identity (public and private
      keys). Cannot be combined with `allow_open` as a permissive mode that
      allows both plain text and TLS is not supported.
