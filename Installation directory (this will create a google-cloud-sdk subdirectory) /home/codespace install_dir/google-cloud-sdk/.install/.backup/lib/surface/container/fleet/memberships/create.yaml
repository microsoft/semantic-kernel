    brief: Create a new membership for a cluster.
    description: |
      Create a Fleet Membership resource corresponding to the cluster.

      This command does not install the Connect Agent or in-cluster Kubernetes Resources that are
      required to connect the cluster with Google. For complete cluster registration, consider using
      the command: `{parent_command} register --help`.
    examples: |
      Create a new membership `MEMBERSHIP_NAME` in the active project's fleet:

        $ {command} MEMBERSHIP_NAME

      Create a new membership `MEMBERSHIP_NAME` for a GKE cluster:

        $ {command} MEMBERSHIP_NAME --gke-cluster-self-link=my-gke-cluster-self-link

        GKE cluster self-link of the cluster represented by this membership;
        for example,
        '//container.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/clusters/my-cluster.'
        This is only valid if the represented cluster is a GKE cluster. The
        provided self-link will be validated to confirm that it maps to the
        cluster represented by this membership.
