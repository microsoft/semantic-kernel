      api_field: googleCloudRecaptchaenterpriseV1FirewallPolicy.description
      help_text: |
        A description of what this policy aims to achieve, for convenience purposes. The description
        can at most include 256 UTF-8 characters.
    - arg_name: path
      api_field: googleCloudRecaptchaenterpriseV1FirewallPolicy.path
      help_text: |
        The path for which this policy applies, specified as a glob pattern. For more information on
        glob, see the manual page: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html.
    - arg_name: condition
      api_field: googleCloudRecaptchaenterpriseV1FirewallPolicy.condition
      help_text: |
        A CEL (Common Expression Language) conditional expression that specifies if this policy
        applies to an incoming user request. If this condition evaluates to true and the requested
        path matched the path pattern, the associated actions should be executed by the caller. The
        condition string is checked for CEL syntax correctness on creation. For more information,
        see the CEL spec: https://github.com/google/cel-spec and its language definition:
        https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md
    - arg_name: actions
      api_field: googleCloudRecaptchaenterpriseV1FirewallPolicy.actions
      processor: googlecloudsdk.command_lib.recaptcha.firewall_policies_util:ParseFirewallActions
      help_text: |
        The actions that the caller should take regarding the user. There should be at most 1
        terminal action. A terminal action is any action that forces a response, such as Allow,
        Block or Substitute. If it makes sense for it to happen multple times, such as SetHeader,
        the action is non-terminal.

        Examples:
        * Block and set the header with key foo to value bar
          ** --actions=block,set_header=foo=bar
        * Substitute with path google.com and set two headers, one with key key1 to value value1 and
        one with key key2 to value value2
          ** --actions=substitute=google.com,set_header=key1=value1,set_header=key2=value2

  output:
    format: none
