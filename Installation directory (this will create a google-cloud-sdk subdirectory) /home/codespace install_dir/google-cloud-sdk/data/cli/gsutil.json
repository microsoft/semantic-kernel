Attempts to do so will appear to succeed, but the service\nwill add the project owners group into the new set of ACLs before applying it.\n\nNote that removing a project requires you to reference the project by\nits number (which you can see with the acl get command) as opposed to its\nproject ID string.\n\nGrant the service account foo@developer.gserviceaccount.com WRITE access to\nthe bucket example-bucket:\n\n  gsutil acl ch -u foo@developer.gserviceaccount.com:W gs://example-bucket\n\nGrant all users from the `G Suite\n<https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/>`_ domain my-domain.org READ\naccess to the bucket gcs.my-domain.org:\n\n  gsutil acl ch -g my-domain.org:R gs://gcs.my-domain.org\n\nRemove any current access by john.doe@example.com from the bucket\nexample-bucket:\n\n  gsutil acl ch -d john.doe@example.com gs://example-bucket\n\nIf you have a large number of objects to update, enabling multi-threading\nwith the gsutil -m flag can significantly improve performance.

As part of the command, you must specify either a\npredefined ACL or the path to a file that contains ACL text. The simplest way\nto use the ``acl set`` command is to specify one of the predefined ACLs,\ne.g.,:\n\n  gsutil acl set private gs://example-bucket/example-object\n\nIf you want to make an object or bucket publicly readable or writable, it is\nrecommended to use ``acl ch``, to avoid accidentally removing OWNER\npermissions. See the ``acl ch`` section for details.\n\nSee `Predefined ACLs\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/lists#predefined-acl>`_\nfor a list of predefined ACLs.\n\nIf you want to define more fine-grained control over your data, you can\nretrieve an ACL using the ``acl get`` command, save the output to a file, edit\nthe file, and then use the ``acl set`` command to set that ACL on the buckets\nand/or objects. For example:\n\n  gsutil acl get gs://bucket/file.txt > acl.txt\n\nMake changes to acl.txt such as adding an additional grant, then:\n\n  gsutil acl set acl.txt gs://cats/file.txt\n\nNote that you can set an ACL on multiple buckets or objects at once. For\nexample, to set ACLs on all .jpg files found in a bucket:\n\n  gsutil acl set acl.txt gs://bucket/**.jpg\n\nIf you have a large number of ACLs to update you might want to use the\ngsutil -m option, to perform a parallel (multi-threaded/multi-processing)\nupdate:\n\n  gsutil -m acl set acl.txt gs://bucket/**.jpg\n\nNote that multi-threading/multi-processing is only done when the named URLs\nrefer to objects, which happens either if you name specific objects or\nif you enumerate objects by using an object wildcard or specifying\nthe acl -r flag."

        "DESCRIPTION": "The ``gsutil config`` command generally applies to users who have legacy\nstandalone installations of gsutil. If you installed gsutil via the Cloud SDK,\n``gsutil config`` fails unless you are specifically using the ``-a`` flag or\nhave configured gcloud to not pass its managed credentials to gsutil (via the\ncommand ``gcloud config set pass_credentials_to_gsutil false``). For all other\nuse cases, Cloud SDK users should use the ``gcloud auth`` group of commands\ninstead, which configures OAuth2 credentials that gcloud implicitly passes to\ngsutil at runtime. To check if you are using gsutil from the Cloud SDK or as a\nlegacy standalone, use ``gsutil version -l`` and in the output look for\n\"using cloud sdk\".\n\nImportant: The default behavior for the ``gsutil config`` command is to obtain\nuser account credentials for authentication. However, user account credentials\nare no longer supported for standalone gsutil. For this reason, running the\ndefault ``gsutil config`` command fails, and using any of the following flags\ncauses the command to fail: ``-b``, ``-f``, ``-r``, ``--reauth``, ``-s``,\n``-w``. When using standalone gsutil, it's recommended that you use\nservice account credentials via the ``-e`` flag.\n\nThe ``gsutil config`` command obtains access credentials for Cloud Storage and\nwrites a `boto/gsutil configuration file\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/boto-gsutil>`_ containing\nthe obtained credentials along with a number of other configuration-\ncontrollable values.\n\nUnless specified otherwise (see OPTIONS), the configuration file is written\nto ~/.boto (i.e., the file .boto under the user's home directory). If the\ndefault file already exists, an attempt is made to rename the existing file\nto ~/.boto.bak; if that attempt fails the command exits. A different\ndestination file can be specified with the ``-o`` option (see OPTIONS).\n\nBecause the boto configuration file contains your credentials you should\nkeep its file permissions set so no one but you has read access. (The file\nis created read-only when you run ``gsutil config``.)",
        "SERVICE ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS": "Service accounts are useful for authenticating on behalf of a service or\napplication (as opposed to a user). If you use gsutil as a legacy\nstand-alone tool, you configure credentials for service accounts using the\n``-e`` option:\n\n  gsutil config -e\n\nNote that if you use gsutil through the Cloud SDK, you instead activate your\nservice account via the `gcloud auth activate-service-account\n<https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/activate-service-account>`_\ncommand.\n\nWhen you run ``gsutil config -e``, you are prompted for the path to your\nprivate key file and, if not using a JSON key file, your service account\nemail address and key file password. To get this data, follow the instructions\non `Service Accounts <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#generating-a-private-key>`_.\nUsing this information, gsutil populates the \"gs_service_key_file\" attribute\nin the boto configuration file. If not using a JSON key file, gsutil also\npopulates the \"gs_service_client_id\" and \"gs_service_key_file_password\"\nattributes.\n\nNote that your service account is NOT considered an Owner for the purposes of\nAPI access (see \"gsutil help creds\" for more information about this). See\nhttps://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount for\nfurther information on service account authentication.\n\nIf you want to use credentials based on access key and secret (the older\nauthentication method before OAuth2 was supported), see the ``-a`` option in\nthe OPTIONS section.\n\nIf you wish to use gsutil with other providers (or to copy data back and\nforth between multiple providers) you can edit their credentials into the\n[Credentials] section after creating the initial boto configuration file."

        "DESCRIPTION": "The ``gsutil cp`` command allows you to copy data between your local file\nsystem and the cloud, within the cloud, and between\ncloud storage providers. For example, to upload all text files from the\nlocal directory to a bucket, you can run:\n\n  gsutil cp *.txt gs://my-bucket\n\nYou can also download data from a bucket. The following command downloads\nall text files from the top-level of a bucket to your current directory:\n\n  gsutil cp gs://my-bucket/*.txt .\n\nYou can use the ``-n`` option to prevent overwriting the content of\nexisting files. The following example downloads text files from a bucket\nwithout clobbering the data in your directory:\n\n  gsutil cp -n gs://my-bucket/*.txt .\n\nUse the ``-r`` option to copy an entire directory tree.\nFor example, to upload the directory tree ``dir``:\n\n  gsutil cp -r dir gs://my-bucket\n\nIf you have a large number of files to transfer, you can perform a parallel\nmulti-threaded/multi-processing copy using the\ntop-level gsutil ``-m`` option (see \"gsutil help options\"):\n\n  gsutil -m cp -r dir gs://my-bucket\n\nYou can use the ``-I`` option with ``stdin`` to specify a list of URLs to\ncopy, one per line. This allows you to use gsutil\nin a pipeline to upload or download objects as generated by a program:\n\n  cat filelist | gsutil -m cp -I gs://my-bucket\n\nor:\n\n  cat filelist | gsutil -m cp -I ./download_dir\n\nwhere the output of ``cat filelist`` is a list of files, cloud URLs, and\nwildcards of files and cloud URLs.\n\nNOTE: Shells like ``bash`` and ``zsh`` sometimes attempt to expand\nwildcards in ways that can be surprising. You may also encounter issues when\nattempting to copy files whose names contain wildcard characters. For more\ndetails about these issues, see `Wildcard behavior considerations\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/wildcards#surprising-behavior>`_.",
        "HANDLING": "The ``cp`` command retries when failures occur, but if enough failures happen\nduring a particular copy or delete operation, or if a failure isn't retryable,\nthe ``cp`` command skips that object and moves on. If any failures were not\nsuccessfully retried by the end of the copy run, the ``cp`` command reports the\nnumber of failures and exits with a non-zero status.\n\nFor details about gsutil's overall retry handling, see `Retry strategy\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/retry-strategy#tools>`_.",
        "IN THE CLOUD AND METADATA PRESERVATION": "If both the source and destination URL are cloud URLs from the same\nprovider, gsutil copies data \"in the cloud\" (without downloading\nto and uploading from the machine where you run gsutil). In addition to\nthe performance and cost advantages of doing this, copying in the cloud\npreserves metadata such as ``Content-Type`` and ``Cache-Control``. In contrast,\nwhen you download data from the cloud, it ends up in a file with\nno associated metadata, unless you have some way to keep\nor re-create that metadata.\n\nCopies spanning locations and/or storage classes cause data to be rewritten\nin the cloud, which may take some time (but is still faster than\ndownloading and re-uploading). Such operations can be resumed with the same\ncommand if they are interrupted, so long as the command parameters are\nidentical.\n\nNote that by default, the gsutil ``cp`` command does not copy the object\nACL to the new object, and instead uses the default bucket ACL (see\n\"gsutil help defacl\"). You can override this behavior with the ``-p``\noption.\n\nWhen copying in the cloud, if the destination bucket has Object Versioning\nenabled, by default ``gsutil cp`` copies only live versions of the\nsource object. For example, the following command causes only the single live\nversion of ``gs://bucket1/obj`` to be copied to ``gs://bucket2``, even if there\nare noncurrent versions of ``gs://bucket1/obj``:\n\n  gsutil cp gs://bucket1/obj gs://bucket2\n\nTo also copy noncurrent versions, use the ``-A`` flag:\n\n  gsutil cp -A gs://bucket1/obj gs://bucket2\n\nThe top-level gsutil ``-m`` flag is  not allowed when using the ``cp -A`` flag.",
        "NAMES ARE CONSTRUCTED": "The ``gsutil cp`` command attempts to name objects in ways that are consistent with the\nLinux ``cp`` command. This means that names are constructed depending\non whether you're performing a recursive directory copy or copying\nindividually-named objects, or whether you're copying to an existing or\nnon-existent directory.\n\nWhen you perform recursive directory copies, object names are constructed to\nmirror the source directory structure starting at the point of recursive\nprocessing. For example, if ``dir1/dir2`` contains the file ``a/b/c``, then the\nfollowing command creates the object ``gs://my-bucket/dir2/a/b/c``:\n\n  gsutil cp -r dir1/dir2 gs://my-bucket\n\nIn contrast, copying individually-named files results in objects named by\nthe final path component of the source files. For example, assuming again that\n``dir1/dir2`` contains ``a/b/c``, the following command creates the object\n``gs://my-bucket/c``:\n\n  gsutil cp dir1/dir2/** gs://my-bucket\n\nNote that in the above example, the '**' wildcard matches all names\nanywhere under ``dir``. The wildcard '*' matches names just one level deep. For\nmore details, see `URI wildcards\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/wildcards#surprising-behavior>`_.\n\nThe same rules apply for uploads and downloads: recursive copies of buckets and\nbucket subdirectories produce a mirrored filename structure, while copying\nindividually or wildcard-named objects produce flatly-named files.\n\nIn addition, the resulting names depend on whether the destination subdirectory\nexists. For example, if ``gs://my-bucket/subdir`` exists as a subdirectory,\nthe following command creates the object ``gs://my-bucket/subdir/dir2/a/b/c``:\n\n  gsutil cp -r dir1/dir2 gs://my-bucket/subdir\n\nIn contrast, if ``gs://my-bucket/subdir`` does not exist, this same ``gsutil cp``\ncommand creates the object ``gs://my-bucket/subdir/a/b/c``.\n\nNOTE: The\n`Google Cloud Platform Console <https://console.cloud.google.com>`_\ncreates folders by creating \"placeholder\" objects that end\nwith a \"/\" character. gsutil skips these objects when downloading from the\ncloud to the local file system, because creating a file that\nends with a \"/\" is not allowed on Linux and macOS. We\nrecommend that you only create objects that end with \"/\" if you don't\nintend to download such objects using gsutil.",
        "OBJECT DOWNLOADS": "gsutil can automatically use ranged ``GET`` requests to perform downloads in\nparallel for large files being downloaded from Cloud Storage. See `sliced object\ndownload documentation\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/sliced-object-downloads>`_\nfor a complete discussion.",
        "OVER OS-SPECIFIC FILE TYPES (SUCH AS SYMLINKS AND DEVICES)": "Please see the section about OS-specific file types in \"gsutil help rsync\".\nWhile that section refers to the ``rsync`` command, analogous\npoints apply to the ``cp`` command.",
        "TEMP DIRECTORIES": "gsutil writes data to a temporary directory in several cases:\n\n- when compressing data to be uploaded (see the ``-z`` and ``-Z`` options)\n- when decompressing data being downloaded (for example, when the data has\n  ``Content-Encoding:gzip`` as a result of being uploaded\n  using gsutil cp -z or gsutil cp -Z)\n- when running integration tests using the gsutil test command\n\nIn these cases, it's possible the temporary file location on your system that\ngsutil selects by default may not have enough space. If gsutil runs out of\nspace during one of these operations (for example, raising\n\"CommandException: Inadequate temp space available to compress <your file>\"\nduring a ``gsutil cp -z`` operation), you can change where it writes these\ntemp files by setting the TMPDIR environment variable. On Linux and macOS,\nyou can set the variable as follows:\n\n  TMPDIR=/some/directory gsutil cp ...\n\nYou can also add this line to your ~/.bashrc file and restart the shell\nbefore running gsutil:\n\n  export TMPDIR=/some/directory\n\nOn Windows 7, you can change the TMPDIR environment variable from Start ->\nComputer -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables.\nYou need to reboot after making this change for it to take effect. Rebooting\nis not necessary after running the export command on Linux and macOS.",
        "TO/FROM SUBDIRECTORIES; DISTRIBUTING TRANSFERS ACROSS MACHINES": "You can use gsutil to copy to and from subdirectories by using a command\nlike this:\n\n  gsutil cp -r dir gs://my-bucket/data\n\nThis causes ``dir`` and all of its files and nested subdirectories to be\ncopied under the specified destination, resulting in objects with names like\n``gs://my-bucket/data/dir/a/b/c``. Similarly, you can download from bucket\nsubdirectories using the following command:\n\n  gsutil cp -r gs://my-bucket/data dir\n\nThis causes everything nested under ``gs://my-bucket/data`` to be downloaded\ninto ``dir``, resulting in files with names like ``dir/data/a/b/c``.\n\nCopying subdirectories is useful if you want to add data to an existing\nbucket directory structure over time. It's also useful if you want\nto parallelize uploads and downloads across multiple machines (potentially\nreducing overall transfer time compared with running ``gsutil -m\ncp`` on one machine). For example, if your bucket contains this structure:\n\n  gs://my-bucket/data/result_set_01/\n  gs://my-bucket/data/result_set_02/\n  ...\n  gs://my-bucket/data/result_set_99/\n\nyou can perform concurrent downloads across 3 machines by running these\ncommands on each machine, respectively:\n\n  gsutil -m cp -r gs://my-bucket/data/result_set_[0-3]* dir\n  gsutil -m cp -r gs://my-bucket/data/result_set_[4-6]* dir\n  gsutil -m cp -r gs://my-bucket/data/result_set_[7-9]* dir\n\nNote that ``dir`` could be a local directory on each machine, or a\ndirectory mounted off of a shared file server. The performance of the latter\ndepends on several factors, so we recommend experimenting\nto find out what works best for your computing environment.",
        "TRANSFERS": "Use '-' in place of src_url or dst_url to perform a `streaming transfer\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/streaming>`_.\n\nStreaming uploads using the `JSON API\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints#gsutil>`_ are buffered\nin memory part-way back into the file and can thus sometimes resume in the event\nof network or service problems.\n\ngsutil does not support resuming streaming uploads using the XML API or\nresuming streaming downloads for either JSON or XML. If you have a large amount\nof data to transfer in these cases, we recommend that you write the data to a\nlocal file and copy that file rather than streaming it.",
        "VALIDATION": "gsutil automatically performs checksum validation for copies to and from Cloud\nStorage. For more information, see `Hashes and ETags\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hashes-etags#cli>`_."

            "ACL JSON": "When you use a canned ACL, it is translated into an JSON representation\nthat can later be retrieved and edited to specify more fine-grained\ndetail about who can read and write buckets and objects. By running\nthe \"gsutil acl get\" command you can retrieve the ACL JSON, and edit it to\ncustomize the permissions.\n\nAs an example, if you create an object in a bucket that has no default\nobject ACL set and then retrieve the ACL on the object, it will look\nsomething like this:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"entity\": \"group-00b4903a9740e42c29800f53bd5a9a62a2f96eb3f64a4313a115df3f3a776bf7\",\n    \"entityId\": \"00b4903a9740e42c29800f53bd5a9a62a2f96eb3f64a4313a115df3f3a776bf7\",\n    \"role\": \"OWNER\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"entity\": \"group-00b4903a977fd817e9da167bc81306489181a110456bb635f466d71cf90a0d51\",\n    \"entityId\": \"00b4903a977fd817e9da167bc81306489181a110456bb635f466d71cf90a0d51\",\n    \"role\": \"OWNER\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"entity\": \"00b4903a974898cc8fc309f2f2835308ba3d3df1b889d3fc7e33e187d52d8e71\",\n    \"entityId\": \"00b4903a974898cc8fc309f2f2835308ba3d3df1b889d3fc7e33e187d52d8e71\",\n    \"role\": \"READER\"\n  }\n]\n\nThe ACL consists collection of elements, each of which specifies an Entity\nand a Role.  Entities are the way you specify an individual or group of\nindividuals, and Roles specify what access they're permitted.\n\nThis particular ACL grants OWNER to two groups (which means members\nof those groups are allowed to read the object and read and write the ACL),\nand READ permission to a third group. The project groups are (in order)\nthe project owners group, editors group, and viewers group.\n\nThe 64 digit hex identifiers (following any prefixes like \"group-\") used in\nthis ACL are called canonical IDs.  They are used to identify predefined\ngroups associated with the project that owns the bucket: the Project Owners,\nProject Editors, and All Project Team Members groups. For more information\nthe permissions and roles of these project groups, see \"gsutil help projects\".\n\nHere's an example of an ACL specified using the group-by-email and\ngroup-by-domain entities:\n\n\n{\n  \"entity\": \"group-travel-companion-owners@googlegroups.com\"\n  \"email\": \"travel-companion-owners@googlegroups.com\",\n  \"role\": \"OWNER\",\n}\n{\n  \"domain\": \"example.com\",\n  \"entity\": \"domain-example.com\"\n  \"role\": \"READER\",\n},\n\n\nThis ACL grants members of an email group OWNER, and grants READ\naccess to any user in a domain (which must be a Google Apps for Business\ndomain). By applying email group grants to a collection of objects\nyou can edit access control for large numbers of objects at once via\nhttp://groups.google.com. That way, for example, you can easily and quickly\nchange access to a group of company objects when employees join and leave\nyour company (i.e., without having to individually change ACLs across\npotentially millions of objects).",
            "BUCKET VS OBJECT ACLS": "In Google Cloud Storage, the bucket ACL works as follows:\n\n- Users granted READ access are allowed to list the bucket contents and read\n  bucket metadata other than its ACL.\n\n- Users granted WRITE access are allowed READ access and also are allowed to\n  write and delete objects in that bucket, including overwriting previously\n  written objects.\n\n- Users granted OWNER access are allowed WRITE access and also are allowed to\n  read and write the bucket's ACL.\n\nThe object ACL works as follows:\n\n- Users granted READ access are allowed to read the object's data and\n  metadata.\n\n- Users granted OWNER access are allowed READ access and also are allowed to\n  read and write the object's ACL.\n\nA couple of points are worth noting, that sometimes surprise users:\n\n1. There is no WRITE access for objects; attempting to set an ACL with WRITE\n   permission for an object will result in an error.\n\n2. The bucket ACL plays no role in determining who can read objects; only the\n   object ACL matters for that purpose. This is different from how things\n   work in Linux file systems, where both the file and directory permission\n   control file read access. It also means, for example, that someone with\n   OWNER over the bucket may not have read access to objects in the bucket.\n   This is by design, and supports useful cases. For example, you might want\n   to set up bucket ownership so that a small group of administrators have\n   OWNER on the bucket (with the ability to delete data to control storage\n   costs), but not grant those users read access to the object data (which\n   might be sensitive data that should only be accessed by a different\n   specific group of users).",
            "CANNED ACLS": "The simplest way to set an ACL on a bucket or object is using a \"canned\nACL\". The available canned ACLs are:\n\nproject-private\n  Gives permission to the project team based on their roles. Anyone who is\n  part of the team has READ permission, and project owners and project editors\n  have OWNER permission. This is the default ACL for newly created\n  buckets. This is also the default ACL for newly created objects unless the\n  default object ACL for that bucket has been changed. For more details see\n  \"gsutil help projects\".\n\nprivate\n  Gives the requester (and only the requester) OWNER permission for a\n  bucket or object.\n\npublic-read\n  Gives all users (whether logged in or anonymous) READ permission. When\n  you apply this to an object, anyone on the Internet can read the object\n  without authenticating.\n\n  NOTE: By default, publicly readable objects are served with a Cache-Control\n  header allowing such objects to be cached for 3600 seconds. If you need to\n  ensure that updates become visible immediately, you should set a\n  Cache-Control header of \"Cache-Control:private, max-age=0, no-transform\" on\n  such objects. For help doing this, see 'gsutil help setmeta'.\n\n  NOTE: Setting a bucket ACL to public-read will remove all OWNER and WRITE\n  permissions from everyone except the project owner group. Setting an object\n  ACL to public-read will remove all OWNER and WRITE permissions from\n  everyone except the object owner. For this reason, we recommend using\n  the \"acl ch\" command to make these changes; see \"gsutil help acl ch\" for\n  details.\n\npublic-read-write\n  Gives all users READ and WRITE permission. This ACL applies only to buckets.\n  NOTE: Setting a bucket to public-read-write will allow anyone on the\n  Internet to upload anything to your bucket. You will be responsible for this\n  content.\n\n  NOTE: Setting a bucket ACL to public-read-write will remove all OWNER\n  permissions from everyone except the project owner group. Setting an object\n  ACL to public-read-write will remove all OWNER permissions from\n  everyone except the object owner. For this reason, we recommend using\n  the \"acl ch\" command to make these changes; see \"gsutil help acl ch\" for\n  details.\n\nauthenticated-read\n  Gives the requester OWNER permission and gives all authenticated\n  Google account holders READ permission.\n\nbucket-owner-read\n  Gives the requester OWNER permission and gives the bucket owner READ\n  permission. This is used only with objects.\n\nbucket-owner-full-control\n  Gives the requester OWNER permission and gives the bucket owner\n  OWNER permission. This is used only with objects.",
            "DESCRIPTION": "Access Control Lists (ACLs) allow you to control who can read and write\nyour data, and who can read and write the ACLs themselves.\n\nIf not specified at the time an object is uploaded (e.g., via the gsutil cp\n-a option), objects will be created with a default object ACL set on the\nbucket (see \"gsutil help defacl\").

For details on this\nvariable, see the surrounding comments in your boto configuration file.

            "DESCRIPTION": "Google Cloud Storage provides a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) header that\nallows clients to verify the integrity of object contents.

The implementation\nof CRC32C used by gsutil is provided by a third-party Python module called\n`crcmod <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/crcmod>`_.\n\nThe crcmod module contains a pure-Python implementation of CRC32C, but using\nit results in slow checksum computation and subsequently very poor\nperformance. A Python C extension is also provided by crcmod, which requires\ncompiling into a binary module for use. gsutil ships with a precompiled\ncrcmod C extension for macOS; for other platforms, see the installation\ninstructions below.\n\nAt the end of each copy operation, the ``gsutil cp``, ``gsutil mv``, and\n``gsutil rsync`` commands validate that the checksum of the source\nfile/object matches the checksum of the destination file/object. If the\nchecksums do not match, gsutil will delete the invalid copy and print a\nwarning message. This very rarely happens, but if it does, you should\nretry the operation.",

You can determine which\n   Python version gsutil is using by running ``gsutil version -l`` and looking\n   for the ``python version: 2.x.x`` or ``python version: 3.x.x`` line.\n\nCentOS, RHEL, and Fedora\n------------------------\n\nTo compile and install crcmod:\n\n  yum install gcc python3-devel python3-setuptools redhat-rpm-config\n  sudo pip3 uninstall crcmod\n  sudo pip3 install --no-cache-dir -U crcmod\n\nDebian and Ubuntu\n-----------------\n\nTo compile and install crcmod:\n\n  sudo apt-get install gcc python3-dev python3-setuptools\n  sudo pip3 uninstall crcmod\n  sudo pip3 install --no-cache-dir -U crcmod\n\nEnterprise SUSE\n-----------------\n\nTo compile and install crcmod when using Enterprise SUSE for SAP 12:\n\n  sudo zypper install gcc python-devel\n  sudo pip uninstall crcmod\n  sudo pip install --no-cache-dir -U crcmod\n\nTo compile and install crcmod when using Enterprise SUSE for SAP 15:\n\n  sudo zypper install gcc python3-devel\n  sudo pip uninstall crcmod\n  sudo pip install --no-cache-dir -U crcmod\n\nmacOS\n-----\n\ngsutil distributes a pre-compiled version of crcmod for macOS, so you shouldn't\nneed to compile and install it yourself. If for some reason the pre-compiled\nversion is not being detected, please let the Google Cloud Storage team know\n(see ``gsutil help support``).\n\nTo compile manually on macOS, you will first need to install\n`Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`_ and then run:\n\n  pip3 install -U crcmod\n\nWindows\n-------\n\nAn installer is available for the compiled version of crcmod from the Python\nPackage Index (PyPi) at the following URL:\n\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/crcmod/1.7\n\nNOTE: If you have installed crcmod and gsutil hasn't detected it, it may have\nbeen installed to the wrong directory. It should be located at\n<python_dir>\\files\\Lib\\site-packages\\crcmod\\\n\nIn some cases the installer will incorrectly install to\n<python_dir>\\Lib\\site-packages\\crcmod\\\n\nManually copying the crcmod directory to the correct location should resolve\nthe issue."

            "DESCRIPTION": "gsutil currently supports several types of credentials/authentication, as\nwell as the ability to `access public data anonymously\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-public-data>`_. Each of these\ntype of credentials is discussed in more detail below, along with\ninformation about configuring and using credentials via the Cloud SDK.",
            "SUPPORTED CREDENTIAL TYPES": "gsutil supports several types of credentials (the specific subset depends on\nwhich distribution of gsutil you are using; see above discussion).\n\nOAuth2 user account:\n  This type of credential can be used for authenticating requests on behalf of\n  a specific user (which is probably the most common use of gsutil). This is\n  the default type of credential that is created when you run ``gcloud init``.\n  This credential type is not supported for stand-alone versions of gsutil.\n  For more details about OAuth2 authentication, see:\n  https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2#scenarios\n\nHMAC:\n  This type of credential can be used by programs that are implemented using\n  HMAC authentication, which is an authentication mechanism supported by\n  certain other cloud storage service providers. This type of credential can\n  also be used for interactive use when moving data to/from service providers\n  that support HMAC credentials. This is the type of credential that is\n  created when you run ``gsutil config -a``.\n\n  Note that it's possible to set up HMAC credentials for both Google Cloud\n  Storage and another service provider; or to set up OAuth2 user account\n  credentials for Google Cloud Storage and HMAC credentials for another\n  service provider. To do so, after you run the ``gcloud init`` command, you\n  can edit the generated ~/.boto config file and look for comments for where\n  other credentials can be added.\n\n  For more details about HMAC authentication, see `HMAC keys for Cloud Storage\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/hmackeys>`_.\n\nOAuth2 service account:\n  This is a credential you can use when authenticating on\n  behalf of a service or application (as opposed to a user). For example, if\n  you intend to run gsutil out of a nightly cron job to upload/download data,\n  using a service account means the cron job does not depend on credentials of\n  an individual employee at your company. This is the type of credential that\n  is configured when you run ``gcloud auth  login`` with the ``--cred-file``\n  flag (or ``gsutil config -e`` when using stand-alone versions of gsutil).\n\n  You should generally avoid this credential type because it requires storing\n  highly-privileged credentials in your local environment, creating potential\n  security risks. Instead, service account impersonation or workload identity\n  federation are the recommended alternatives when authenticating on behalf of\n  a service or application.\n\n  It is important to note that a service account is considered an Editor by\n  default for the purposes of API access, rather than an Owner. In particular,\n  the fact that Editors have OWNER access in the default object and\n  bucket ACLs, but the predefined ACL options remove OWNER access from\n  Editors, can lead to unexpected results. The solution to this problem is to\n  use \"gsutil acl ch\" instead of \"gsutil acl set <predefined-ACL>\" to change\n  permissions on a bucket.\n\n  To set up a service account for use with gsutil, see\n  `Authorize a service account using a service account key\n  <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#key>`_.\n\n  For more details about OAuth2 service accounts, see\n  `Using OAuth 2.0 for server to server applications\n  <https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account>`_.\n\nCompute Engine internal service account:\n  This is the type of service account used for accounts hosted by App Engine\n  or Compute Engine. Such credentials are created automatically for\n  you on Compute Engine when you run the ``gcloud compute instances create``\n  command and the credentials can be controlled with the ``--scopes`` flag.\n\n  For more details about using service account credentials for authenticating workloads\n  on Compute Engine, see\n  https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances.\n\n  For more details about App Engine service accounts, see\n  https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/appidentity/overview\n\nService account impersonation:\n  Impersonating a service account is useful in scenarios where you need to\n  grant short-term access to specific resources. For example, if you have a\n  bucket of sensitive data that is typically read-only and want to\n  temporarily grant write access through a trusted service account.\n\n  You can specify which service account to use for impersonation by running\n  ``gsutil -i``, ``gsutil config -e`` and editing the boto configuration file, or\n  ``gcloud config set auth/impersonate_service_account [service_account_email_address]``.\n\n  In order to impersonate, your original credentials need to be granted\n  roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator on the target service account.\n  For more information see\n  https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/use-service-account-impersonation.\n\nExternal account credentials (workload identity federation):\n  Using workload identity federation, you can access Google Cloud resources\n  from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure or any identity provider\n  that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) or SAML 2.0.\n\n  For more information see\n  https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation."

Before we can accept code submissions, we have to jump a couple of legal\n   hurdles. Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor\n   License Agreement:\n\n   - If you are an individual writing original source code and you're\n     sure you own the intellectual property,\n     then you'll need to sign an individual CLA\n     (https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual).\n   - If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your\n     work to gsutil, then you'll need to sign a corporate CLA\n     (https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate)\n\n   Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and\n   instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll\n   add you to the official list of contributors and be able to accept\n   your patches.\n\n2. If you found a bug or have an idea for a feature enhancement, we suggest\n   you check https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil/issues to see if it\n   has already been reported by another user. From there you can also\n   subscribe to updates to the issue.\n\n   If a GitHub issue doesn't already exist, create one about your idea before\n   sending actual code. Often we can discuss the idea and help propose things\n   that could save you later revision work.\n\n3. We tend to avoid adding command line options that are of use to only\n   a very small fraction of users, especially if there's some other way\n   to accommodate such needs. Adding such options complicates the code and\n   also adds overhead to users having to read through an \"alphabet soup\"\n   list of option documentation.\n\n4. While gsutil has a number of features specific to Google Cloud Storage,\n   it can also be used with other cloud storage providers. We're open to\n   including changes for making gsutil support features specific to other\n   providers, as long as those changes don't make gsutil work worse for Google\n   Cloud Storage. If you do make such changes we recommend including someone\n   with knowledge of the specific provider as a code reviewer (see below).\n\n5. You can check out the gsutil code from the GitHub repository:\n\n     https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil\n\n   To clone a read-only copy of the repository:\n\n     git clone git://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil.git\n\n   To push your own changes to GitHub, click the Fork button on the\n   repository page and clone the repository from your own fork.\n\n6. The gsutil git repository uses git submodules to pull in external modules.\n   After checking out the repository, make sure to also pull the submodules\n   by entering into the gsutil top-level directory and run:\n\n     git submodule update --init --recursive\n\n7. Please make sure to run all tests against your modified code. To\n   do this, change directories into the gsutil top-level directory and run:\n\n     ./gsutil test\n\n   The above tests take a long time to run because they send many requests to\n   the production service. The gsutil test command has a -u argument that will\n   only run unit tests. These run quickly, as they are executed with an\n   in-memory mock storage service implementation. To run only the unit tests,\n   run:\n\n     ./gsutil test -u\n\n   If you made changes to boto, please run the boto tests. For these tests you\n   need to use HMAC credentials (from gsutil config -a), because the boto test\n   suite doesn't import the OAuth2 handler. You'll also need to install some\n   Python modules. Change directories into the boto root directory at\n   third_party/boto and run:\n\n     pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n   (You probably need to run this command using sudo.)\n   Make sure each of the individual installations succeeded. If they don't\n   you may need to run the install command again.\n\n   Then ensure your .boto file has HMAC credentials defined, and then change\n   directories into boto's tests directory and run:\n\n     python test.py unit\n     python test.py -t s3 -t gs -t ssl\n\n8. Please consider contributing test code for your change, especially if the\n   change impacts any of the core gsutil code (like the gsutil cp command).\n\n9. Please run the yapf linter with the config files in the root of the GitHub\n   repository:\n\n     yapf -irp .\n\n10. When it's time to send us code, please submit a PR to the `gsutil GitHub\n    repository <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil>`_.

            "CROSS-PLATFORM ENCODING PROBLEMS OF WHICH TO BE AWARE": "Using UTF-8 for all object names and filenames will ensure that gsutil doesn't\nencounter character encoding errors while operating on the files.\nUnfortunately, it's still possible that files uploaded / downloaded this way\ncan have interoperability problems, for a number of reasons unrelated to\ngsutil. For example:\n\n- Windows filenames are case-insensitive, while Google Cloud Storage, Linux,\n  and macOS are not. Thus, for example, if you have two filenames on Linux\n  differing only in case and upload both to Google Cloud Storage and then\n  subsequently download them to Windows, you will end up with just one file\n  whose contents came from the last of these files to be written to the\n  filesystem.\n- macOS performs character encoding decomposition based on tables stored in\n  the OS, and the tables change between Unicode versions. Thus the encoding\n  used by an external library may not match that performed by the OS. It is\n  possible that two object names may translate to a single local filename.\n- Windows console support for Unicode is difficult to use correctly.\n\nFor a more thorough list of such issues see `this presentation\n<http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/filename-issues-iuc33.pdf>`_\n\nThese problems mostly arise when sharing data across platforms (e.g.,\nuploading data from a Windows machine to Google Cloud Storage, and then\ndownloading from Google Cloud Storage to a machine running macOS).\nUnfortunately these problems are a consequence of the lack of a filename\nencoding standard, and users need to be aware of the kinds of problems that\ncan arise when copying filenames across platforms.\n\nThere is one precaution users can exercise to prevent some of these problems:\nWhen using the Windows console specify wildcards or folders (using the -R\noption) rather than explicitly named individual files.",
            "DESCRIPTION": "To reduce the chance for `filename encoding interoperability problems\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename#Encoding_indication_interoperability>`_\ngsutil uses `UTF-8 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8>`_ character encoding\nwhen uploading and downloading files. Because UTF-8 is in widespread (and\ngrowing) use, for most users nothing needs to be done to use UTF-8. Users with\nfiles stored in other encodings (such as\n`Latin 1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1>`_) must convert those\nfilenames to UTF-8 before attempting to upload the files.\n\nThe most common place where users who have filenames that use some other\nencoding encounter a gsutil error is while uploading files using the recursive\n(-R) option on the gsutil cp , mv, or rsync commands. When this happens you'll\nget an error like this:\n\n    CommandException: Invalid Unicode path encountered\n    ('dir1/dir2/file_name_with_\\xf6n_bad_chars').\n    gsutil cannot proceed with such files present.\n    Please remove or rename this file and try again.\n\nNote that the invalid Unicode characters have been hex-encoded in this error\nmessage because otherwise trying to print them would result in another\nerror.\n\nIf you encounter such an error you can either remove the problematic file(s)\nor try to rename them and re-run the command. If you have a modest number of\nsuch files the simplest thing to do is to think of a different name for the\nfile and manually rename the file (using local filesystem tools). If you have\ntoo many files for that to be practical, you can use a bulk rename tool or\nscript.\n\nUnicode errors for valid Unicode filepaths can be caused by lack of Python\nlocale configuration on Linux and Mac OSes. If your file paths are Unicode\nand you get encoding errors, ensure the LANG environment variable is set\ncorrectly. Typically, the LANG variable should be set to something like\n\"en_US.UTF-8\" or \"de_DE.UTF-8\".\n\nNote also that there's no restriction on the character encoding used in file\ncontent - it can be UTF-8, a different encoding, or non-character\ndata (like audio or video content). The gsutil UTF-8 character encoding\nrequirement applies only to filenames.",
            "USING UNICODE FILENAMES ON MACOS": "macOS stores filenames in decomposed form (also known as\n`NFD normalization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence>`_).\nFor example, if a filename contains an accented \"e\" character, that character\nwill be converted to an \"e\" followed by an accent before being saved to the\nfilesystem. As a consequence, it's possible to have different name strings\nfor files uploaded from an operating system that doesn't enforce decomposed\nform (like Ubuntu) from one that does (like macOS).\n\nThe following example shows how this behavior could lead to unexpected\nresults. Say you create a file with non-ASCII characters on Ubuntu. Ubuntu\nstores that filename in its composed form. When you upload the file to the\ncloud, it is stored as named. But if you use gsutil rysnc to bring the file to\na macOS machine and edit the file, then when you use gsutil rsync to bring\nthis version back to the cloud, you end up with two different objects, instead\nof replacing the original. This is because macOS converted the filename to\na decomposed form, and Cloud Storage sees this as a different object name.",
            "USING UNICODE FILENAMES ON WINDOWS": "Windows support for Unicode in the command shell (cmd.exe or powershell) is\nsomewhat painful, because Windows uses a Windows-specific character encoding\ncalled `cp1252 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252>`_. To use Unicode\ncharacters you need to run this command in the command shell before the first\ntime you use gsutil in that shell:\n\n  chcp 65001\n\nIf you neglect to do this before using gsutil, the progress messages while\nuploading files with Unicode names or listing buckets with Unicode object\nnames will look garbled (i.e., with different glyphs than you expect in the\noutput). If you simply run the chcp command and re-run the gsutil command, the\noutput should no longer look garbled.\n\ngsutil attempts to translate between cp1252 encoding and UTF-8 in the main\nplaces that Unicode encoding/decoding problems have been encountered to date\n(traversing the local file system while uploading files, and printing Unicode\nnames while listing buckets). However, because gsutil must perform\ntranslation, it is likely there are other erroneous edge cases when using\nWindows with Unicode. If you encounter problems, you might consider instead\nusing cygwin (on Windows) or Linux or macOS - all of which support Unicode."

For a\ndiscussion of specific metadata properties, see the `metadata concept\npage <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/metadata>`_.\n\nThere are two ways to set metadata on objects:\n\n- At upload time you can specify one or more metadata properties to\n  associate with objects, using the ``gsutil -h option``.  For example,\n  the following command would cause gsutil to set the ``Content-Type`` and\n  ``Cache-Control`` for each of the files being uploaded from a local\n  directory named ``images``:\n\n    gsutil -h \"Content-Type:text/html\" \\\n           -h \"Cache-Control:public, max-age=3600\" cp -r images \\\n           gs://bucket/images\n\n  Note that -h is an option on the gsutil command, not the cp sub-command.\n\n- You can set or remove metadata fields from already uploaded objects using\n  the ``gsutil setmeta`` command.

            "NAMED BUCKETS": "You can carve out parts of the Google Cloud Storage bucket name space\nby creating buckets with domain names (like \"example.com\").\n\nBefore you can create a bucket name containing one or more '.' characters,\nthe following rules apply:\n\n- If the name is a syntactically valid DNS name ending with a\n  currently-recognized top-level domain (such as .com), you will be required\n  to verify domain ownership.\n- Otherwise you will be disallowed from creating the bucket.\n\nIf your project needs to use a domain-named bucket, you need to have\na team member both verify the domain and create the bucket. This is\nbecause Google Cloud Storage checks for domain ownership against the\nuser who creates the bucket, so the user who creates the bucket must\nalso be verified as an owner or manager of the domain.\n\nTo verify as the owner or manager of a domain, use the Google Webmaster\nTools verification process. The Webmaster Tools verification process\nprovides three methods for verifying an owner or manager of a domain:\n\n1. Adding a special Meta tag to a site's homepage.\n2. Uploading a special HTML file to a site.\n3. Adding a DNS TXT record to a domain's DNS configuration.\n\nMeta tag verification and HTML file verification are easier to perform and\nare probably adequate for most situations. DNS TXT record verification is\na domain-based verification method that is useful in situations where a\nsite wants to tightly control who can create domain-named buckets. Once\na site creates a DNS TXT record to verify ownership of a domain, it takes\nprecedence over meta tag and HTML file verification. For example, you might\nhave two IT staff members who are responsible for managing your site, called\n\"example.com.\" If they complete the DNS TXT record verification, only they\nwould be able to create buckets called \"example.com\", \"reports.example.com\",\n\"downloads.example.com\", and other domain-named buckets.\n\nSite-Based Verification\n-----------------------\n\nIf you have administrative control over the HTML files that make up a site,\nyou can use one of the site-based verification methods to verify that you\ncontrol or own a site. When you do this, Google Cloud Storage lets you\ncreate buckets representing the verified site and any sub-sites - provided\nnobody has used the DNS TXT record method to verify domain ownership of a\nparent of the site.\n\nAs an example, assume that nobody has used the DNS TXT record method to verify\nownership of the following domains: abc.def.example.com, def.example.com,\nand example.com. In this case, Google Cloud Storage lets you create a bucket\nnamed abc.def.example.com if you verify that you own or control any of the\nfollowing sites:\n\n  http://abc.def.example.com\n  http://def.example.com\n  http://example.com\n\nDomain-Based Verification\n-------------------------\n\nIf you have administrative control over a domain's DNS configuration, you can\nuse the DNS TXT record verification method to verify that you own or control a\ndomain. When you use the domain-based verification method to verify that you\nown or control a domain, Google Cloud Storage lets you create buckets that\nrepresent any subdomain under the verified domain. Furthermore, Google Cloud\nStorage prevents anybody else from creating buckets under that domain unless\nyou add their name to the list of verified domain owners or they have verified\ntheir domain ownership by using the DNS TXT record verification method.\n\nFor example, if you use the DNS TXT record verification method to verify your\nownership of the domain example.com, Google Cloud Storage will let you create\nbucket names that represent any subdomain under the example.com domain, such\nas abc.def.example.com, example.com/music/jazz, or abc.example.com/music/jazz.\n\nUsing the DNS TXT record method to verify domain ownership supersedes\nverification by site-based verification methods. For example, if you\nuse the Meta tag method or HTML file method to verify domain ownership\nof http://example.com, but someone else uses the DNS TXT record method\nto verify ownership of the example.com domain, Google Cloud Storage will\nnot allow you to create a bucket named example.com. To create the bucket\nexample.com, the domain owner who used the DNS TXT method to verify domain\nownership must add you to the list of verified domain owners for example.com.\n\nThe DNS TXT record verification method is particularly useful if you manage\na domain for a large organization that has numerous subdomains because it\nlets you control who can create buckets representing those domain names.\n\nNote: If you use the DNS TXT record verification method to verify ownership of\na domain, you cannot create a CNAME record for that domain. RFC 1034 disallows\ninclusion of any other resource records if there is a CNAME resource record\npresent. If you want to create a CNAME resource record for a domain, you must\nuse the Meta tag verification method or the HTML file verification method."

            "BACKGROUND ON RESUMABLE TRANSFERS": "First, it's helpful to understand gsutil's resumable transfer mechanism,\nand how your script needs to be implemented around this mechanism to work\nreliably. gsutil uses resumable transfer support when you attempt to download\na file of any size or to upload a file larger than a configurable threshold\n(by default, this threshold is 8 MiB). If a transfer fails partway through\n(e.g., because of an intermittent network problem), gsutil uses a\n`truncated randomized binary exponential backoff-and-retry strategy\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/retry-strategy#tools>`_ that by\ndefault retries transfers up to 23 times over a 10 minute period of time. If\nthe transfer fails each of these attempts with no intervening progress,\ngsutil gives up on the transfer, but keeps a \"tracker\" file for it in a\nconfigurable location (the default location is ~/.gsutil/, in a file named\nby a combination of the SHA1 hash of the name of the bucket and object being\ntransferred and the last 16 characters of the file name). When transfers\nfail in this fashion, you can rerun gsutil at some later time (e.g., after\nthe networking problem has been resolved), and the resumable transfer picks\nup where it left off.",
            "DESCRIPTION": "If you use gsutil in large production tasks (such as uploading or\ndownloading many GiBs of data each night), there are a number of things\nyou can do to help ensure success. Specifically, this section discusses\nhow to script large production tasks around gsutil's resumable transfer\nmechanism.",
            "SCRIPTING DATA TRANSFER TASKS": "To script large production data transfer tasks around this mechanism,\nyou can implement a script that runs periodically, determines which file\ntransfers have not yet succeeded, and runs gsutil to copy them. Below,\nwe offer a number of suggestions about how this type of scripting should\nbe implemented:\n\n1. When resumable transfers fail without any progress 23 times in a row\n   over the course of up to 10 minutes, it probably won't work to simply\n   retry the transfer immediately. A more successful strategy would be to\n   have a cron job that runs every 30 minutes, determines which transfers\n   need to be run, and runs them. If the network experiences intermittent\n   problems, the script picks up where it left off and will eventually\n   succeed (once the network problem has been resolved).\n\n2. If your business depends on timely data transfer, you should consider\n   implementing some network monitoring. For example, you can implement\n   a task that attempts a small download every few minutes and raises an\n   alert if the attempt fails for several attempts in a row (or more or less\n   frequently depending on your requirements), so that your IT staff can\n   investigate problems promptly. As usual with monitoring implementations,\n   you should experiment with the alerting thresholds, to avoid false\n   positive alerts that cause your staff to begin ignoring the alerts.\n\n3. There are a variety of ways you can determine what files remain to be\n   transferred. We recommend that you avoid attempting to get a complete\n   listing of a bucket containing many objects (e.g., tens of thousands\n   or more). One strategy is to structure your object names in a way that\n   represents your transfer process, and use gsutil prefix wildcards to\n   request partial bucket listings. For example, if your periodic process\n   involves downloading the current day's objects, you could name objects\n   using a year-month-day-object-ID format and then find today's objects by\n   using a command like gsutil ls \"gs://bucket/2011-09-27-*\". Note that it\n   is more efficient to have a non-wildcard prefix like this than to use\n   something like gsutil ls \"gs://bucket/*-2011-09-27\". The latter command\n   actually requests a complete bucket listing and then filters in gsutil,\n   while the former asks Google Storage to return the subset of objects\n   whose names start with everything up to the \"*\".\n\n   For data uploads, another technique would be to move local files from a \"to\n   be processed\" area to a \"done\" area as your script successfully copies\n   files to the cloud. You can do this in parallel batches by using a command\n   like:\n\n     gsutil -m cp -r to_upload/subdir_$i gs://bucket/subdir_$i\n\n   where i is a shell loop variable. Make sure to check the shell $status\n   variable is 0 after each gsutil cp command, to detect if some of the copies\n   failed, and rerun the affected copies.\n\n   With this strategy, the file system keeps track of all remaining work to\n   be done.\n\n4. If you have really large numbers of objects in a single bucket\n   (say hundreds of thousands or more), you should consider tracking your\n   objects in a database instead of using bucket listings to enumerate\n   the objects. For example this database could track the state of your\n   downloads, so you can determine what objects need to be downloaded by\n   your periodic download script by querying the database locally instead\n   of performing a bucket listing.\n\n5. Make sure you don't delete partially downloaded temporary files after a\n   transfer fails: gsutil picks up where it left off (and performs a hash\n   of the final downloaded content to ensure data integrity), so deleting\n   partially transferred files will cause you to lose progress and make\n   more wasteful use of your network.\n\n6. If you have a fast network connection, you can speed up the transfer of\n   large numbers of files by using the gsutil -m (multi-threading /\n   multi-processing) option. Be aware, however, that gsutil doesn't attempt to\n   keep track of which files were downloaded successfully in cases where some\n   files failed to download. For example, if you use multi-threaded transfers\n   to download 100 files and 3 failed to download, it is up to your scripting\n   process to determine which transfers didn't succeed, and retry them. A\n   periodic check-and-run approach like outlined earlier would handle this\n   case.\n\n   If you use parallel transfers (gsutil -m) you might want to experiment with\n   the number of threads being used (via the parallel_thread_count setting\n   in the .boto config file). By default, gsutil uses 10 threads for Linux\n   and 24 threads for other operating systems. Depending on your network\n   speed, available memory, CPU load, and other conditions, this may or may\n   not be optimal. Try experimenting with higher or lower numbers of threads\n   to find the best number of threads for your environment."

Make sure to redact this information\nbefore sending this debug output to anyone during troubleshooting/tech support\ninteractions.\n\nIf you run gsutil --trace-token (to send a trace directly to Google),\nsensitive information like OAuth2 tokens and the contents of any files\naccessed during the trace may be included in the content of the trace.\n\nCustomer-supplied encryption key information in the .boto configuration is\nsecurity sensitive.\n\nThe proxy configuration information in the .boto configuration is\nsecurity-sensitive, especially if your proxy setup requires user and\npassword information. Even if your proxy setup doesn't require user and\npassword, the host and port number for your proxy is often considered\nsecurity-sensitive. Protect access to your .boto configuration file.\n\nIf you are using gsutil from a production environment (e.g., via a cron job\nrunning on a host in your data center), use service account credentials rather\nthan individual user account credentials. These credentials were designed for\nsuch use and, for example, protect you from losing access when an employee\nleaves your company.",
            "SECURITY-SENSITIVE FILES WRITTEN TEMPORARILY TO DISK BY GSUTIL": "gsutil buffers data in temporary files in several situations:\n\n- While compressing data being uploaded via gsutil cp -z/-Z, gsutil\n  buffers the data in temporary files with protection 600, which it\n  deletes after the upload is complete (similarly for downloading files\n  that were uploaded with gsutil cp -z/-Z or some other process that sets the\n  Content-Encoding to \"gzip\"). However, if you kill the gsutil process\n  while the upload is under way the partially written file will be left\n  in place. See the \"CHANGING TEMP DIRECTORIES\" section in\n  \"gsutil help cp\" for details of where the temporary files are written\n  and how to change the temp directory location.\n\n- When performing a resumable upload gsutil stores the upload ID (which,\n  as noted above, is a bearer token and thus should be safe-guarded) in a\n  file under ~/.gsutil/tracker-files with protection 600, and deletes this\n  file after the upload is complete. However, if the upload doesn't\n  complete successfully the tracker file is left in place so the resumable\n  upload can be re-attempted later. Over time it's possible to accumulate\n  these tracker files from aborted upload attempts, though resumable\n  upload IDs are only valid for 1 week, so the security risk only exists\n  for files less than that age. If you consider the risk of leaving\n  aborted upload IDs in the tracker directory too high you could modify\n  your upload scripts to delete the tracker files; or you could create a\n  cron job to clear the tracker directory periodically.\n\n- The gsutil rsync command stores temporary files (with protection 600)\n  containing the names, sizes, and checksums of source and destination\n  directories/buckets, which it deletes after the rsync is complete.\n  However, if you kill the gsutil process while the rsync is under way the\n  listing files will be left in place.\n\nNote that gsutil deletes temporary files using the standard OS unlink system\ncall, which does not perform `data wiping\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_erasure>`_. Thus, the content of such\ntemporary files can be recovered by a determined adversary.",
            "SOFTWARE INTEGRITY AND UPDATES": "gsutil is distributed as a part of the bundled Cloud SDK release. This\ndistribution method takes a variety of security precautions to protect the\nintegrity of the software. We strongly recommend against getting a copy of\ngsutil from any other sources (such as mirror sites).",
            "TRANSPORT LAYER SECURITY": "gsutil performs all operations using transport-layer encryption (HTTPS), to\nprotect against data leakage over shared network links. This is also important\nbecause gsutil uses \"bearer tokens\" for authentication (OAuth2) as well as for\nresumable upload identifiers, and such tokens must be protected from being\neavesdropped and reused.\n\ngsutil also supports the older HMAC style of authentication via the XML API\n(see `gsutil endpoints\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints#gsutil>`_).  While\nHMAC authentication does not use bearer tokens (and thus is not subject to\neavesdropping/replay attacks), it's still important to encrypt data traffic.\n\nTo add an extra layer of security, gsutil supports mutual TLS (mTLS) for\nthe Cloud Storage JSON API. With mTLS, the client verifies the server\ncertificate, and the server also verifies the client.\nTo find out more about how to enable mTLS, see the `install docs\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install>`_."

            "DESCRIPTION": "Cloud SDK includes a new CLI, gcloud storage, that can be considerably faster\nthan gsutil when performing uploads and downloads with less parameter\ntweaking. This new CLI has a syntax and command structure that is familiar to\ngsutil users but is fundamentally different in many important ways. To ease\ntransition to this new CLI, gsutil provides a shim that translates your gsutil\ncommands to gcloud storage commands if an equivalent exists, and falls back to\ngsutil's usual behavior if an equivalent does not exist.",
            "GENERAL COMPATIBILITY NOTES": "- Due to its compatibility across all major platforms, multiprocessing is\n  enabled for all commands by default (equivalent to the -m option always\n  being included in gsutil).\n- A sequence of asterisks greater than 2 (i.e. ``***``) are always treated as\n  a single asterisk.\n- Unlike gsutil, gcloud is not designed to be used in parallel invocations,\n  and doing so (i.e. running the shim from 2 terminals at once) can lead to\n  unpredictable behavior.\n- Assuming a bucket contains an object ``gs://bucket/nested/foo.txt``,\n  gsutil's wildcard iterator will match ``foo.txt`` given a URL like\n  ``gs://bucket/*/nested/*``. The shim will not match ``foo.txt`` given the\n  same URL.\n- This will be updated as new commands are supported by both gcloud storage\n  and the shim.\n- If Unicode is having issues, try setting the environment variable\n  ``PYTHONUTF8`` to ``1``. Specifically, this may help on the Windows\n  command-line (CMD).",

Noncurrent objects are ignored by gsutil commands\nunless you indicate it should do otherwise by setting a relevant command flag\nor by including a specific generation number in your command. For example,\nwildcards like ``*`` and ``**`` do not, by themselves, act on noncurrent\nobject versions.\n\nWhen using gsutil cp, you cannot specify a version-specific URL as the\ndestination, because writes to Cloud Storage always create a new version.\nTrying to specify a version-specific URL as the destination of ``gsutil cp``\nresults in an error. When you specify a noncurrent object as a source in a\ncopy command, you always create a new object version and retain the original\n(even when using the command to restore a live version). You can use the\n``gsutil mv`` command to simultaneously restore an object version and remove\nthe noncurrent copy that was used as the source.\n\nYou can turn versioning on or off for a bucket at any time. Turning\nversioning off leaves existing object versions in place and simply causes\nthe bucket to delete the existing live version of the object whenever a new\nversion is uploaded.\n\nRegardless of whether you have enabled versioning on a bucket, every object\nhas two associated positive integer fields:\n\n- the generation, which is updated when a new object replaces an existing\n  object with the same name. Note that there is no guarantee that generation\n  numbers increase for successive versions, only that each new version has a\n  unique generation number.\n- the metageneration, which identifies the metadata generation. It starts\n  at 1; is updated every time the metadata (e.g., ACL or Content-Type) for a\n  given content generation is updated; and gets reset when the generation\n  number changes.\n\nOf these two integers, only the generation is used when working with versioned\ndata. Both generation and metageneration can be used with concurrency control.\n\nTo learn more about versioning and concurrency, see the following documentation:\n\n- `Overview of Object Versioning\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning>`_\n- `Guide for using Object Versioning\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-object-versioning>`_\n- The `reference page for the gsutil versioning command\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/versioning>`_\n- `Request preconditions\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-preconditions>`_"

        "OPERATION": "Unlike the case with many file systems, the gsutil mv command does not\nperform a single atomic operation.

        "DESCRIPTION": "The gsutil rewrite command rewrites cloud objects, applying the specified\ntransformations to them. The transformation(s) are atomic for each affected\nobject and applied based on the input transformation flags. Object metadata\nvalues are preserved unless altered by a transformation. At least one\ntransformation flag, -k or -s, must be included in the command.\n\nThe -k flag is supported to add, rotate, or remove encryption keys on\nobjects.  For example, the command:\n\n  gsutil rewrite -k -r gs://bucket\n\nupdates all objects in gs://bucket with the current encryption key\nfrom your boto config file, which may either be a base64-encoded CSEK or the\nfully-qualified name of a Cloud KMS key.\n\nThe rewrite command acts only on live object versions, so specifying a\nURL with a generation number fails. If you want to rewrite a noncurrent\nversion, first copy it to the live version, then rewrite it, for example:\n\n  gsutil cp gs://bucket/object#123 gs://bucket/object\n  gsutil rewrite -k gs://bucket/object\n\nYou can use the -s option to specify a new storage class for objects.  For\nexample, the command:\n\n  gsutil rewrite -s nearline gs://bucket/foo\n\nrewrites the object, changing its storage class to nearline.\n\nIf you specify the -k option and you have an encryption key set in your boto\nconfiguration file, the rewrite command skips objects that are already\nencrypted with the specified key.  For example, if you run:\n\n  gsutil rewrite -k -r gs://bucket\n\nand gs://bucket contains objects encrypted with the key specified in your boto\nconfiguration file, gsutil skips rewriting those objects and only rewrites\nobjects that are not encrypted with the specified key. This avoids the cost of\nperforming redundant rewrite operations.\n\nIf you specify the -k option and you do not have an encryption key set in your\nboto configuration file, gsutil always rewrites each object, without\nexplicitly specifying an encryption key. This results in rewritten objects\nbeing encrypted with either the bucket's default KMS key (if one is set) or\nGoogle-managed encryption (no CSEK or CMEK). Gsutil does not attempt to\ndetermine whether the operation is redundant (and thus skippable) because\ngsutil cannot be sure how the object is encrypted after the rewrite. Note that\nif your goal is to encrypt objects with a bucket's default KMS key, you can\navoid redundant rewrite costs by specifying the bucket's default KMS key in\nyour boto configuration file; this allows gsutil to perform an accurate\ncomparison of the objects' current and desired encryption configurations and\nskip rewrites for objects already encrypted with that key.\n\nIf have an encryption key set in your boto configuration file and specify\nmultiple transformations, gsutil only skips those that would not change\nthe object's state. For example, if you run:\n\n  gsutil rewrite -s nearline -k -r gs://bucket\n\nand gs://bucket contains objects that already match the encryption\nconfiguration but have a storage class of standard, the only transformation\napplied to those objects would be the change in storage class.\n\nYou can pass a list of URLs (one per line) to rewrite on stdin instead of as\ncommand line arguments by using the -I option. This allows you to use gsutil\nin a pipeline to rewrite objects identified by a program, such as:\n\n  some_program | gsutil -m rewrite -k -I\n\nThe contents of stdin can name cloud URLs and wildcards of cloud URLs.\n\nThe rewrite command requires OWNER permissions on each object to preserve\nobject ACLs. You can bypass this by using the -O flag, which causes\ngsutil not to read the object's ACL and instead apply the default object ACL\nto the rewritten object:\n\n  gsutil rewrite -k -O -r gs://bucket"

        "CAREFUL WHEN SYNCHRONIZING OVER OS-SPECIFIC FILE TYPES (SYMLINKS, DEVICES, ETC.)": "Running gsutil rsync over a directory containing operating system-specific\nfile types (symbolic links, device files, sockets, named pipes, etc.) can\ncause various problems. For example, running a command like:\n\n  gsutil rsync -r ./dir gs://my-bucket\n\nwill cause gsutil to follow any symbolic links in ./dir, creating objects in\nmy-bucket containing the data from the files to which the symlinks point. This\ncan cause various problems:\n\n* If you use gsutil rsync as a simple way to backup a directory to a bucket,\n  restoring from that bucket will result in files where the symlinks used\n  to be. At best this is wasteful of space, and at worst it can result in\n  outdated data or broken applications -- depending on what is consuming\n  the symlinks.\n\n* If you use gsutil rsync over directories containing broken symlinks,\n  gsutil rsync will abort (unless you pass the -e option).\n\n* gsutil rsync skips symlinks that point to directories.\n\nSince gsutil rsync is intended to support data operations (like moving a data\nset to the cloud for computational processing) and it needs to be compatible\nboth in the cloud and across common operating systems, there are no plans for\ngsutil rsync to support operating system-specific file types like symlinks.\n\nWe recommend that users do one of the following:\n\n* Don't use gsutil rsync over directories containing symlinks or other OS-\n  specific file types.\n* Use the -e option to exclude symlinks or the -x option to exclude\n  OS-specific file types by name.\n* Use a tool (such as tar) that preserves symlinks and other OS-specific file\n  types, packaging up directories containing such files before uploading to\n  the cloud.",
        "CONSISTENCY WITH NON-GOOGLE CLOUD PROVIDERS": "While Google Cloud Storage is strongly consistent, some cloud providers\nonly support eventual consistency. You may encounter scenarios where rsync\nsynchronizes using stale listing data when working with these other cloud\nproviders. For example, if you run rsync immediately after uploading an\nobject to an eventually consistent cloud provider, the added object may not\nyet appear in the provider's listing. Consequently, rsync will miss adding\nthe object to the destination. If this happens you can rerun the rsync\noperation again later (after the object listing has \"caught up\").",
        "DESCRIPTION": "The gsutil rsync command makes the contents under dst_url the same as the\ncontents under src_url, by copying any missing files/objects (or those whose\ndata has changed), and (if the -d option is specified) deleting any extra\nfiles/objects. src_url must specify a directory, bucket, or bucket\nsubdirectory. For example, to sync the contents of the local directory \"data\"\nto the bucket gs://mybucket/data, you could do:\n\n  gsutil rsync data gs://mybucket/data\n\nTo recurse into directories use the -r option:\n\n  gsutil rsync -r data gs://mybucket/data\n\nIf you have a large number of objects to synchronize you might want to use the\ngsutil -m option (see \"gsutil help options\"), to perform parallel\n(multi-threaded/multi-processing) synchronization:\n\n  gsutil -m rsync -r data gs://mybucket/data\n\nThe -m option typically will provide a large performance boost if either the\nsource or destination (or both) is a cloud URL. If both source and\ndestination are file URLs the -m option will typically thrash the disk and\nslow synchronization down.\n\nNote 1: Shells (like bash, zsh) sometimes attempt to expand wildcards in ways\nthat can be surprising. Also, attempting to copy files whose names contain\nwildcard characters can result in problems. For more details about these\nissues see `Wildcard behavior considerations\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/wildcards#surprising-behavior>`_.\n\nNote 2: If you are synchronizing a large amount of data between clouds you\nmight consider setting up a\n`Google Compute Engine <https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine>`_\naccount and running gsutil there. Since cross-provider gsutil data transfers\nflow through the machine where gsutil is running, doing this can make your\ntransfer run significantly faster than running gsutil on your local\nworkstation.\n\nNote 3: rsync does not copy empty directory trees, since Cloud Storage uses a\n`flat namespace <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/folders>`_.",
        "DETECTION ALGORITHM": "To determine if a file or object has changed, gsutil rsync first checks\nwhether the file modification time (mtime) of both the source and destination\nis available. If mtime is available at both source and destination, and the\ndestination mtime is different than the source, or if the source and\ndestination file size differ, gsutil rsync will update the destination. If the\nsource is a cloud bucket and the destination is a local file system, and if\nmtime is not available for the source, gsutil rsync will use the time created\nfor the cloud object as a substitute for mtime. Otherwise, if mtime is not\navailable for either the source or the destination, gsutil rsync will fall\nback to using checksums. If the source and destination are both cloud buckets\nwith checksums available, gsutil rsync will use these hashes instead of mtime.\nHowever, gsutil rsync will still update mtime at the destination if it is not\npresent. If the source and destination have matching checksums and only the\nsource has an mtime, gsutil rsync will copy the mtime to the destination. If\nneither mtime nor checksums are available, gsutil rsync will resort to\ncomparing file sizes.\n\nChecksums will not be available when comparing composite Google Cloud Storage\nobjects with objects at a cloud provider that does not support CRC32C (which\nis the only checksum available for composite objects). See 'gsutil help\ncompose' for details about composite objects.",
        "HANDLING": "The rsync command retries failures when it is useful to do so, but if\nenough failures happen during a particular copy or delete operation, or if\na failure isn't retryable, the overall command fails.\n\nIf the -C option is provided, the command instead skips failing objects and\nmoves on. At the end of the synchronization run, if any failures were not\nsuccessfully retried, the rsync command reports the count of failures and\nexits with non-zero status. At this point you can run the rsync command\nagain, and gsutil attempts any remaining needed copy and/or delete\noperations.\n\nFor more details about gsutil's retry handling, see `Retry strategy\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/retry-strategy#tools>`_.",
        "IN THE CLOUD AND METADATA PRESERVATION": "If both the source and destination URL are cloud URLs from the same provider,\ngsutil copies data \"in the cloud\" (i.e., without downloading to and uploading\nfrom the machine where you run gsutil). In addition to the performance and\ncost advantages of doing this, copying in the cloud preserves metadata (like\nContent-Type and Cache-Control). In contrast, when you download data from the\ncloud it ends up in a file, which has no associated metadata, other than file\nmodification time (mtime). Thus, unless you have some way to hold on to or\nre-create that metadata, synchronizing a bucket to a directory in the local\nfile system will not retain the metadata other than mtime.\n\nNote that by default, the gsutil rsync command does not copy the ACLs of\nobjects being synchronized and instead will use the default bucket ACL (see\n\"gsutil help defacl\"). You can override this behavior with the -p option. See\nthe `Options section\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/rsync#options>`_ to\nlearn how.",
        "LIMITATIONS": "1. The gsutil rsync command will only allow non-negative file modification\n   times to be used in its comparisons. This means gsutil rsync will resort to\n   using checksums for any file with a timestamp before 1970-01-01 UTC.\n\n2. The gsutil rsync command considers only the live object version in\n   the source and destination buckets when deciding what to copy / delete. If\n   versioning is enabled in the destination bucket then gsutil rsync's\n   replacing or deleting objects will end up creating versions, but the\n   command doesn't try to make any noncurrent versions match in the source\n   and destination buckets.\n\n3. The gsutil rsync command does not support copying special file types\n   such as sockets, device files, named pipes, or any other non-standard\n   files intended to represent an operating system resource. If you run\n   gsutil rsync on a source directory that includes such files (for example,\n   copying the root directory on Linux that includes /dev ), you should use\n   the -x flag to exclude these files. Otherwise, gsutil rsync may fail or\n   hang.\n\n4. The gsutil rsync command copies changed files in their entirety and does\n   not employ the\n   `rsync delta-transfer algorithm <https://rsync.samba.org/tech_report/>`_\n   to transfer portions of a changed file. This is because Cloud Storage\n   objects are immutable and no facility exists to read partial object\n   checksums or perform partial replacements."

It takes one or more header arguments followed by one or\nmore URLs, where each header argument is in one of two forms:\n\n- If you specify ``header:value``, it sets the provided value for the\n  given header on all applicable objects.\n\n- If you specify ``header`` (with no value), it removes the given header\n  from all applicable objects.\n\nFor example, the following command sets the ``Content-Type`` and\n``Cache-Control`` headers while also removing the ``Content-Disposition``\nheader on the specified objects:\n\n  gsutil setmeta -h \"Content-Type:text/html\" \\\n    -h \"Cache-Control:public, max-age=3600\" \\\n    -h \"Content-Disposition\" gs://bucket/*.html\n\nIf you have a large number of objects to update you might want to use the\ngsutil -m option, to perform a parallel (multi-threaded/multi-processing)\nupdate:\n\n  gsutil -m setmeta -h \"Content-Type:text/html\" \\\n    -h \"Cache-Control:public, max-age=3600\" \\\n    -h \"Content-Disposition\" gs://bucket/*.html\n\nYou can also use the setmeta command to set custom metadata on an object:\n\n  gsutil setmeta -h \"x-goog-meta-icecreamflavor:vanilla\" gs://bucket/object\n\nCustom metadata is always prefixed in gsutil with ``x-goog-meta-``. This\ndistinguishes it from standard request headers. Other tools that send and\nreceive object metadata by using the request body do not use this prefix.\n\nWhile gsutil supports custom metadata with arbitrary Unicode values, note\nthat when setting metadata using the XML API, which sends metadata as HTTP\nheaders, Unicode characters are encoded using UTF-8, then url-encoded to\nASCII. For example:\n\n  gsutil setmeta -h \"x-goog-meta-foo: ã\" gs://bucket/object\n\nstores the custom metadata key-value pair of ``foo`` and ``%C3%A3``.\nSubsequently, running ``ls -L`` using the JSON API to list the object's\nmetadata prints ``%C3%A3``, while ``ls -L`` using the XML API url-decodes\nthis value automatically, printing the character ``ã``.\n\nThe setmeta command reads each object's current generation and metageneration\nand uses those as preconditions unless they are otherwise specified by\ntop-level arguments. For example, the following command sets the custom\nmetadata ``icecreamflavor:vanilla`` if the current live object has a\nmetageneration of 2:\n\n  gsutil -h \"x-goog-if-metageneration-match:2\" setmeta\n    -h \"x-goog-meta-icecreamflavor:vanilla\"\n\nSee `Object metadata <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/metadata>`_ for\nmore information about object metadata."

Please\nsee the `Signed URLs documentation\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls>`_ for\nbackground about signed URLs.\n\nMultiple gs:// URLs may be provided and may contain wildcards. A signed URL\nwill be produced for each provided URL, authorized\nfor the specified HTTP method and valid for the given duration.\n\nNOTE: Unlike the gsutil ls command, the signurl command does not support\noperations on sub-directories. For example, unless you have an object named\n``some-directory/`` stored inside the bucket ``some-bucket``, the following\ncommand returns an error: ``gsutil signurl <private-key-file> gs://some-bucket/some-directory/``\n\nThe signurl command uses the private key for a service account (the\n'<private-key-file>' argument) to generate the cryptographic\nsignature for the generated URL. The private key file must be in PKCS12\nor JSON format. If the private key is encrypted the signed URL command will\nprompt for the passphrase used to protect the private key file\n(default 'notasecret'). For more information regarding generating a private\nkey for use with the signurl command please see the `Authentication\ndocumentation.\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#generating-a-private-key>`_\n\nIf you used `service account credentials\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/CredentialTypesSupportingVariousUseCases#supported-credential-types_1>`_\nfor authentication, you can replace the  <private-key-file> argument with\nthe -u or --use-service-account option to use the system-managed private key\ndirectly. This avoids the need to store a private key file locally, but\nprior to using this flag you must `configure\n<https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/activate-service-account>`_\n``gcloud`` to use your service account credentials.",

It is similar to running:\n\n  gsutil ls -L gs://some-bucket/some-object\n\nbut is more efficient because it avoids listing objects and gets the minimum\nnecessary amount of object metadata. Moreover, because it avoids listing\nobjects (which for some storage providers are eventually consistent) the\n``gsutil stat`` command provides a strongly consistent way to check for the\nexistence (and read the metadata) of an object.\n\nThe ``gsutil stat`` command does, however, make listing object requests if\nyou specify URLs using wildcards.\n\nIf run with the ``gsutil -q`` option nothing is printed, e.g.:\n\n  gsutil -q stat gs://some-bucket/some-object\n\nThis behavior can be useful when writing scripts: even though nothing is\nprinted from the command, it still has an exit status of 0 for an existing\nobject and 1 for a non-existent object.\n\nNOTE: Unlike the gsutil ls command, the stat command does not support\noperations on sub-directories. For example, if you run the command:\n\n  gsutil -q stat gs://some-bucket/some-subdir/\n\ngsutil looks for information about an object called \"some-subdir/\" (with a\ntrailing slash) inside the bucket \"some-bucket\", as opposed to operating on\nobjects nested under gs://some-bucket/some-subdir/. Unless you actually have\nan object with that name, the operation fails. However, you can use the stat\ncommand on objects within subdirectories. For example, this command works\nas expected:\n\n  gsutil -q stat gs://some-bucket/some-subdir/file.txt"

To limit the number of tests run in parallel to 10 at a time:\n\n  gsutil test -p 10\n\nTo force tests to run sequentially:\n\n  gsutil test -p 1\n\nTo have sequentially-run tests stop running immediately when an error occurs:\n\n  gsutil test -f\n\nTo run tests for one or more individual commands add those commands as\narguments. For example, the following command will run the cp and mv command\ntests:\n\n  gsutil test cp mv\n\nTo list available tests, run the test command with the -l argument:\n\n  gsutil test -l\n\nThe tests are defined in the code under the gslib/tests module. Each test\nfile is of the format test_[name].py where [name] is the test name you can\npass to this command. For example, running \"gsutil test ls\" would run the\ntests in \"gslib/tests/test_ls.py\".\n\nYou can also run an individual test class or function name by passing the\ntest module followed by the class name and optionally a test name. For\nexample, to run the an entire test class by name:\n\n  gsutil test naming.GsutilNamingTests\n\nor an individual test function:\n\n  gsutil test cp.TestCp.test_streaming\n\nYou can list the available tests under a module or class by passing arguments\nwith the -l option. For example, to list all available test functions in the\ncp module:\n\n  gsutil test -l cp\n\nTo output test coverage:\n\n  gsutil test -c -p 500\n  coverage html\n\nThis will output an HTML report to a directory named 'htmlcov'.\n\nTest coverage is compatible with v4.1 of the coverage module\n(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage)."

        "DESCRIPTION": "Cloud Storage allows you to configure a bucket to behave like a static\nwebsite when the bucket is accessed through a `custom domain\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints#custom-domains>`_.\nFor example, if you set a ``main_page_suffix``, a subsequent GET bucket\nrequest through a custom domain serves the specified \"main\" page instead of\nperforming the usual bucket listing. Similarly, if you set an ``error_page``,\na subsequent GET object request through a custom domain for a non-existent\nobject serves the specified error page instead of the standard Cloud Storage\nerror.\n\nRequests to a bucket through other `endpoints\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints>`_ are unaffected\nby the bucket's website configuration.\n\nSee `Static website examples and tips\n<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/static-website>`_ for additional\nexamples and information.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Because the main page is only served when a bucket listing request is made\n   via a custom domain endpoint, you can continue to use ``gsutil ls`` as you\n   normally would for bucket listing.\n\n2. The main_page_suffix applies to each subdirectory of the bucket. For\n   example, with the main_page_suffix configured to be index.html, a GET\n   request for ``http://www.example.com`` retrieves\n   ``http://www.example.com/index.html`` but shows ``http://www.example.com`` as\n   the URL to the requester, and a GET request for\n   ``http://www.example.com/photos`` retrieves\n   ``http://www.example.com/photos/index.html`` but shows ``http://www.example.com/photos``\n   as the URL to the requester.\n\n3. There is just one 404.html page. For example, a GET request for\n   ``http://www.example.com/photos/missing`` retrieves\n   ``http://www.example.com/404.html``, not\n   ``http://www.example.com/photos/404.html``.\n\nThe web command has two sub-commands:",

      "description": "Causes supported operations (acl ch, acl set, cp, mv, rm, rsync,\nd setmeta) to run in parallel. This can significantly improve\nrformance if you are performing operations on a large number of\nles over a reasonably fast network connection.\nutil performs the specified operation using a combination of\nlti-threading and multi-processing. The number of threads\nd processors are determined by ``parallel_thread_count`` and\nparallel_process_count``, respectively. These values are set in\ne .boto configuration file or specified in individual requests\nth the ``-o`` top-level flag. Because gsutil has no built-in\npport for throttling requests, you should experiment with these\nlues. The optimal values can vary based on a number of factors,\ncluding network speed, number of CPUs, and available memory.\ning the -m option can consume a significant amount of network\nndwidth and cause problems or make your performance worse if\nu use a slower network. For example, if you start a large rsync\neration over a network link that's also used by a number of\nher important jobs, there could be degraded performance in\nose jobs. Similarly, the -m option can make your performance\nrse, especially for cases that perform all operations locally,\ncause it can \"thrash\" your local disk.\n prevent such issues, reduce the values for\nparallel_thread_count`` and ``parallel_process_count``, or stop\ning the -m option entirely. One tool that you can use to limit\nw much I/O capacity gsutil consumes and prevent it from\nnopolizing your local disk is `ionice\nttp://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/ionice.htm>`_\nuilt in to many Linux systems). For example, the following\nmmand reduces the I/O priority of gsutil so it doesn't\nnopolize your local disk:\nionice -c 2 -n 7 gsutil -m rsync -r ./dir gs://some bucket\n a download or upload operation using parallel transfer fails\nfore the entire transfer is complete (e.g. failing after 300 of\n00 files have been transferred), you must restart the entire\nansfer.\nso, although most commands normally fail upon encountering an\nror when the -m flag is disabled, all commands continue to try\nl operations when -m is enabled with multiple threads or\nocesses, and the number of failed operations (if any) are\nported as an exception at the end of the command's execution.",
