    # A Python hook points to a module, class, an optionally a sub attribute
    # or function. The thing it points to will be called by the framework
    # and must have the function signature required by that particular hook.
    # If arguments are given (:foo=bar,baz=stuff), The function will first be
    # called with those arguments, and the return value will be used as the
    # callable hook.
    # Examples:
    #   googlecloudsdk.module:classname
    #   googlecloudsdk.module:class.attribute
    #   googlecloudsdk.module:class.function:foo=bar,baz=stuff
