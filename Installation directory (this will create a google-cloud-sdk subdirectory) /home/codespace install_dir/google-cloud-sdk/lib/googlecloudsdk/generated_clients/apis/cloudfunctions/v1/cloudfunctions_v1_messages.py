  AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a
  specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that
  service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the
  exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with

  sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ
  logging. It also exempts `jose@example.com` from DATA_READ logging, and
  `aliya@example.com` from DATA_WRITE logging.

      request. If the condition evaluates to `false`, then this binding does
      not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding
      might grant the same role to one or more of the principals in this
      binding. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
      policies, see the [IAM

      used to build the function. The format of this field is
      `projects/{project}/locations/{region}/workerPools/{workerPool}` where
      `{project}` and `{region}` are the project id and region respectively
      where the worker pool is defined and `{workerPool}` is the short name of
      the worker pool. If the project id is not the same as the function, then
      the Cloud Functions Service Agent (`service-@gcf-admin-
      robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) must be granted the role Cloud Build
      Custom Workers Builder (`roles/cloudbuild.customworkers.builder`) in the
      project.
    buildpackStack: Specifies one of the Google provided buildpack stacks.
    customStackUri: Deprecated: customization experience was significantly
      revised, making this field obsolete. It was never revealed to public.
      The URL of a customer provided buildpack stack.
    description: User-provided description of a function.
    dockerRegistry: Docker Registry to use for this deployment. If
      unspecified, it defaults to `ARTIFACT_REGISTRY`. If `docker_repository`
      field is specified, this field should either be left unspecified or set
      to `ARTIFACT_REGISTRY`.
    dockerRepository: User managed repository created in Artifact Registry
      optionally with a customer managed encryption key. If specified,
      deployments will use Artifact Registry. If unspecified and the
      deployment is eligible to use Artifact Registry, GCF will create and use
      a repository named 'gcf-artifacts' for every deployed region. This is
      the repository to which the function docker image will be pushed after
      it is built by Cloud Build. It must match the pattern
      `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/repositories/{repository}`.
      Cross-project repositories are not supported. Cross-location
      repositories are not supported. Repository format must be 'DOCKER'.
    entryPoint: The name of the function (as defined in source code) that will
      be executed. Defaults to the resource name suffix (ID of the function),
      if not specified.
    environmentVariables: Environment variables that shall be available during
      function execution.
    eventTrigger: A source that fires events in response to a condition in
      another service.
    httpsTrigger: An HTTPS endpoint type of source that can be triggered via
      URL.

      to encrypt/decrypt function resources. It must match the pattern `projec
      ts/{project}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{key_ring}/cryptoKeys/{crypto
      _key}`. If specified, you must also provide an artifact registry
      repository using the `docker_repository` field that was created with the
      same KMS crypto key. The following service accounts need to be granted
      the role 'Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter
      (roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter)' on the
      Key/KeyRing/Project/Organization (least access preferred). 1. Google
      Cloud Functions service account (service-{project_number}@gcf-admin-
      robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com) - Required to protect the function's
      image. 2. Google Storage service account (service-{project_number}@gs-
      project-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com) - Required to protect the
      function's source code. If this service account does not exist,
      deploying a function without a KMS key or retrieving the service agent
      name provisions it. For more information, see
      https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects#service-agents and
      https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/getting-service-agent#gsutil.
      Google Cloud Functions delegates access to service agents to protect
      function resources in internal projects that are not accessible by the
      end user.
    labels: Labels associated with this Cloud Function.
    maxInstances: The limit on the maximum number of function instances that
      may coexist at a given time. In some cases, such as rapid traffic
      surges, Cloud Functions may, for a short period of time, create more
      instances than the specified max instances limit. If your function
      cannot tolerate this temporary behavior, you may want to factor in a
      safety margin and set a lower max instances value than your function can
      tolerate. See the [Max
      Instances](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/max-instances) Guide
      for more details.
    minInstances: A lower bound for the number function instances that may
      coexist at a given time.
    name: A user-defined name of the function. Function names must be unique
      globally and match pattern `projects/*/locations/*/functions/*`
    network: Deprecated: use vpc_connector
    onDeployUpdatePolicy: A OnDeployUpdatePolicy attribute.
    pinnedRuntimeVersionPolicy: A PinnedRuntimeVersionPolicy attribute.
    runDockerfile: Local path to the dockerfile for customizing the base image
      for the worker, located within the source folder.
    runtime: The runtime in which to run the function. Required when deploying
      a new function, optional when updating an existing function. For a
      complete list of possible choices, see the [`gcloud` command reference](
      https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/functions/deploy#--
      runtime).
    secretEnvironmentVariables: Secret environment variables configuration.
    secretVolumes: Secret volumes configuration.
    serviceAccountEmail: The email of the function's service account. If
      empty, defaults to `{project_id}@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`.
    sourceArchiveUrl: The Google Cloud Storage URL, starting with `gs://`,
      pointing to the zip archive which contains the function.
    sourceRepository: **Beta Feature** The source repository where a function
      is hosted.
    sourceToken: Input only. An identifier for Firebase function sources.
      Disclaimer: This field is only supported for Firebase function
      deployments.
    sourceUploadUrl: The Google Cloud Storage signed URL used for source
      uploading, generated by calling
      [google.cloud.functions.v1.GenerateUploadUrl]. The signature is
      validated on write methods (Create, Update) The signature is stripped
      from the Function object on read methods (Get, List)
    status: Output only. Status of the function deployment.
    timeout: The function execution timeout. Execution is considered failed
      and can be terminated if the function is not completed at the end of the
      timeout period. Defaults to 60 seconds.
    updateTime: Output only. The last update timestamp of a Cloud Function.
    versionId: Output only. The version identifier of the Cloud Function. Each
      deployment attempt results in a new version of a function being created.
    vpcConnector: The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can
      connect to. It can be either the fully-qualified URI, or the short name
      of the network connector resource. The format of this field is
      `projects/*/locations/*/connectors/*` This field is mutually exclusive
      with `network` field and will eventually replace it. See [the VPC
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vpc) for more
      information on connecting Cloud projects.
    vpcConnectorEgressSettings: The egress settings for the connector,
      controlling what traffic is diverted through it.

  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To

      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
