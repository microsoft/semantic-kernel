      policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
    members: Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud

class BooleanPolicy(_messages.Message):

  this resource.

  Fields:
    enforced: If `true`, then the `Policy` is enforced. If `false`, then any
      configuration is acceptable. Suppose you have a `Constraint`
      `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess` with `constraint_default`
      set to `ALLOW`. A `Policy` for that `Constraint` exhibits the following
      behavior: - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to
      `false`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If the
      `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `true`, serial port
      connection attempts will be refused. - If the `Policy` at this resource
      is `RestoreDefault`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. -
      If no `Policy` is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the
      resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. -
      If no `Policy` is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the
      resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the`Policy` were set at this
      resource. The following examples demonstrate the different possible
      layerings: Example 1 (nearest `Constraint` wins): `organizations/foo`
      has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has no `Policy`
      set. The constraint at `projects/bar` and `organizations/foo` will not
      be enforced. Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced): `organizations/foo`
      has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has a `Policy`
      with: {enforced: true} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is not
      enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is enforced. Example 3
      (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced:
      true} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {RestoreDefault: {}} The
      constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced. The constraint at
      `projects/bar` is not enforced, because `constraint_default` for the
      `Constraint` is `ALLOW`.

  resource. `ListPolicy` can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud
  Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`)
  that are allowed or denied by setting the `allowed_values` and
  `denied_values` fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional
  `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree
  values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required
  only if the value contains a ":". Values prefixed with "is:" are treated the
  same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the
  following formats: - "projects/", e.g. "projects/tokyo-rain-123" -
  "folders/", e.g. "folders/1234" - "organizations/", e.g.
  "organizations/1234" The `supports_under` field of the associated
  `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set
  `allowed_values` and `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is
  `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all
  values. If `all_values` is set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`, `allowed_values`
  and `denied_values` must be unset.

  Enums:
    AllValuesValueValuesEnum: The policy all_values state.

  Fields:
    allValues: The policy all_values state.
    allowedValues: List of values allowed at this resource. Can only be set if
      `all_values` is set to `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`.
    deniedValues: List of values denied at this resource. Can only be set if
      `all_values` is set to `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`.
    inheritFromParent: Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`.
      By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supersedes any `Policy` set
      anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is
      set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent
      resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are
      added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy`
      hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn't
      recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and
      understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with
      `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set.
      In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values`
      and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a
      `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a
      `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default`
      set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is
      applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}.
      Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that
      has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to
      DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following
      examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar`
      parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values):
      `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "E1"
      allowed_values:"E2"} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false`
      and values: {allowed_values: "E3" allowed_values: "E4"} The accepted
      values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at
      `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values):
      `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "E1"
      allowed_values:"E2"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value:
      "E3" value: "E4" inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at
      `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at
      `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting
      both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with
      values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"} `projects/bar` has a
      `Policy` with: {denied_values: "E1"} The accepted values at
      `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar`
      is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy`
      with values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values:"E2"} `projects/bar`
      has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at
      `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at
      `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of
      `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no
      policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set.
      `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels
      are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default`
      (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing
      all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values:
      "E1" allowed_values: "E2"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all:
      ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any
      value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing
      none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values:
      "E1" allowed_values: "E2"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all:
      DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value
      is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees
      of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy
      O1->{F1, F2}; F1->{P1}; F2->{P2, P3}, `organizations/foo` has a `Policy`
      with values: {allowed_values: "under:organizations/O1"} `projects/bar`
      has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: "under:projects/P3"}
      {denied_values: "under:folders/F2"} The accepted values at

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
