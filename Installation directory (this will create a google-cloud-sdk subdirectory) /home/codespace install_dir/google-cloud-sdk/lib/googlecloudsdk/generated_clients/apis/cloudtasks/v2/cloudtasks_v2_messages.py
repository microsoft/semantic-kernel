class AppEngineHttpRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""App Engine HTTP request. The message defines the HTTP request that is
  sent to an App Engine app when the task is dispatched. Using
  AppEngineHttpRequest requires [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.g
  oogle.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for
  the project and the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-
  platform` The task will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to
  the same project as the queue. For more information, see [How Requests are
  Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-
  requests-are-routed) and how routing is affected by [dispatch
  files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref).
  Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters.
  Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to
  Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS).
  The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP
  protocol. The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is
  delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level: * If
  app_engine_routing_override is set on the queue, this value is used for all
  tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the task-level
  app_engine_routing. The `url` that the task will be sent to is: * `url =`
  host `+` relative_uri Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers,
  unsecure app handlers, and URIs restricted with [`login: admin`](https://clo
  ud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref). Because tasks
  are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs restricted with
  [`login: required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/
  config/appref) Task dispatches also do not follow redirects. The task
  attempt has succeeded if the app's request handler returns an HTTP response
  code in the range [`200` - `299`]. The task attempt has failed if the app's
  handler returns a non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does not receive
  response before the deadline. Failed tasks will be retried according to the
  retry configuration. `503` (Service Unavailable) is considered an App Engine
  system error instead of an application error and will cause Cloud Tasks'
  traffic congestion control to temporarily throttle the queue's dispatches.
  Unlike other types of task targets, a `429` (Too Many Requests) response
  from an app handler does not cause traffic congestion control to throttle
  the queue.

  Enums:
    HttpMethodValueValuesEnum: The HTTP method to use for the request. The
      default is POST. The app's request handler for the task's target URL
      must be able to handle HTTP requests with this http_method, otherwise
      the task attempt fails with error code 405 (Method Not Allowed). See
      [Writing a push task request handler](https://cloud.google.com/appengine
      /docs/java/taskqueue/push/creating-
      handlers#writing_a_push_task_request_handler) and the App Engine
      documentation for your runtime on [How Requests are
      Handled](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/how-
      requests-are-handled).

  Messages:
    HeadersValue: HTTP request headers. This map contains the header field
      names and values. Headers can be set when the task is created. Repeated
      headers are not supported but a header value can contain commas. Cloud
      Tasks sets some headers to default values: * `User-Agent`: By default,
      this header is `"AppEngine-Google;
      (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"`. This header can be modified, but
      Cloud Tasks will append `"AppEngine-Google;
      (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"` to the modified `User-Agent`. If
      the task has a body, Cloud Tasks sets the following headers: * `Content-
      Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to
      `"application/octet-stream"`. The default can be overridden by
      explicitly setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the
      task is created. For example, `Content-Type` can be set to
      `"application/json"`. * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud
      Tasks. This value is output only. It cannot be changed. The headers
      below cannot be set or overridden: * `Host` * `X-Google-*` *
      `X-AppEngine-*` In addition, Cloud Tasks sets some headers when the task
      is dispatched, such as headers containing information about the task;
      see [request headers](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-
      appengine-handlers#reading_request_headers). These headers are set only
      when the task is dispatched, so they are not visible when the task is
      returned in a Cloud Tasks response. Although there is no specific limit
      for the maximum number of headers or the size, there is a limit on the
      maximum size of the Task. For more information, see the CreateTask
      documentation.

  Fields:
    appEngineRouting: Task-level setting for App Engine routing. * If
      app_engine_routing_override is set on the queue, this value is used for
      all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the task-level
      app_engine_routing.
    body: HTTP request body. A request body is allowed only if the HTTP method
      is POST or PUT. It is an error to set a body on a task with an
      incompatible HttpMethod.

      and values. Headers can be set when the task is created. Repeated
      headers are not supported but a header value can contain commas. Cloud

      Handled](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/how-
      requests-are-handled).
    relativeUri: The relative URI. The relative URI must begin with "/" and
      must be a valid HTTP relative URI. It can contain a path and query
      string arguments. If the relative URI is empty, then the root path "/"
      will be used. No spaces are allowed, and the maximum length allowed is
      2083 characters.

      or a task that was deleted or executed recently then the call will fail
      with ALREADY_EXISTS. The IDs of deleted tasks are not immediately

      queue was created using a queue.yaml or queue.xml) for the task ID to be

      to identify duplicate task names, these CreateTask calls have
      significantly increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or
      for the prefix of the task id is recommended. Choosing task ids that are
      sequential or have sequential prefixes, for example using a timestamp,
      causes an increase in latency and error rates in all task commands. The

      ids to store and serve tasks efficiently.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).

    rateLimits: Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config

      the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or
      a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task
      after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task
      retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue's actual
      dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-
      specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue's state.
      * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service

      sudden large traffic spikes.
    retryConfig: Settings that determine the retry behavior. * For tasks

        calls or task dispatches) for 30 days, the queue may take a few
        minutes to re-activate. Some method calls may return NOT_FOUND and
        tasks may not be dispatched for a few minutes until the queue has been
        re-activated.
      PAUSED: Tasks are paused by the user. If the queue is paused then Cloud
        Tasks will stop delivering tasks from it, but more tasks can still be
        added to it by the user.
      DISABLED: The queue is disabled. A queue becomes `DISABLED` when [queue.

        or [queue.xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/c
        onfig/queueref) is uploaded which does not contain the queue. You
        cannot directly disable a queue. When a queue is disabled, tasks can
        still be added to a queue but the tasks are not dispatched. To
        permanently delete this queue and all of its tasks, call DeleteQueue.

  r"""Rate limits. This message determines the maximum rate that tasks can be
  dispatched by a queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is a first task
  attempt or a retry. Note: The debugging command, RunTask, will run a task
  even if the queue has reached its RateLimits.

  Fields:
    maxBurstSize: Output only. The max burst size. Max burst size limits how
      fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and
      the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so
      processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits
      resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.
      The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is
      used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token
      bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by
      `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed
      from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue's bucket runs
      out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens
      based on max_dispatches_per_second. Cloud Tasks will pick the value of
      `max_burst_size` based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. For
      queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`,
      `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appe
      ngine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). Since
      `max_burst_size` is output only, if UpdateQueue is called on a queue
      created by `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` will be reset based on the
      value of max_dispatches_per_second, regardless of whether
      max_dispatches_per_second is updated.
    maxConcurrentDispatches: The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud
      Tasks allows to be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has
      been reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of
      concurrent requests decreases. If unspecified when the queue is created,

      there will be `max_attempts - 1` retries). Must be >= -1. If unspecified

      [task_retry_limit in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/

    maxBackoff: A task will be scheduled for retry between min_backoff and
      max_backoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig
      specifies that the task should be retried. If unspecified when the queue
      is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. The value must be given

    maxDoublings: The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times.
      A task's retry interval starts at min_backoff, then doubles
      `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at
      intervals of max_backoff up to max_attempts times. For example, if
      min_backoff is 10s, max_backoff is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then
      the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double
      three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task
      will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted
      max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s,
      160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created,

      [max_doublings in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/doc

    maxRetryDuration: If positive, `max_retry_duration` specifies the time
      limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first
      attempted. Once `max_retry_duration` time has passed *and* the task has
      been attempted max_attempts times, no further attempts will be made and
      the task will be deleted. If zero, then the task age is unlimited. If
      unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the
      default. The value must be given as a string that indicates the length
