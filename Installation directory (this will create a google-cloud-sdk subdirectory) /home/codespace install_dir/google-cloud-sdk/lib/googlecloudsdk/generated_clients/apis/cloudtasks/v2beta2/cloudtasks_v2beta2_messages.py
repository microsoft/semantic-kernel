class AppEngineHttpRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""App Engine HTTP request. The message defines the HTTP request that is
  sent to an App Engine app when the task is dispatched. This proto can only
  be used for tasks in a queue which has app_engine_http_target set. Using
  AppEngineHttpRequest requires [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.g
  oogle.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for
  the project and the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-
  platform` The task will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to
  the same project as the queue. For more information, see [How Requests are
  Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-
  requests-are-routed) and how routing is affected by [dispatch
  files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref).
  Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters.
  Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to
  Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS).
  The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP
  protocol. The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is
  delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level: * If set,
  app_engine_routing_override is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter
  what the setting is for the task-level app_engine_routing. The `url` that
  the task will be sent to is: * `url =` host `+` relative_url Tasks can be
  dispatched to secure app handlers, unsecure app handlers, and URIs
  restricted with [`login: admin`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/sta
  ndard/python/config/appref). Because tasks are not run as any user, they
  cannot be dispatched to URIs restricted with [`login: required`](https://clo
  ud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref) Task dispatches
  also do not follow redirects. The task attempt has succeeded if the app's
  request handler returns an HTTP response code in the range [`200` - `299`].
  The task attempt has failed if the app's handler returns a non-2xx response
  code or Cloud Tasks does not receive response before the deadline. Failed
  tasks will be retried according to the retry configuration. `503` (Service
  Unavailable) is considered an App Engine system error instead of an
  application error and will cause Cloud Tasks' traffic congestion control to
  temporarily throttle the queue's dispatches. Unlike other types of task
  targets, a `429` (Too Many Requests) response from an app handler does not
  cause traffic congestion control to throttle the queue.

  Enums:
    HttpMethodValueValuesEnum: The HTTP method to use for the request. The
      default is POST. The app's request handler for the task's target URL
      must be able to handle HTTP requests with this http_method, otherwise
      the task attempt fails with error code 405 (Method Not Allowed). See
      [Writing a push task request handler](https://cloud.google.com/appengine

      Handled](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/how-
      requests-are-handled).

  Messages:
    HeadersValue: HTTP request headers. This map contains the header field
      names and values. Headers can be set when the task is created. Repeated
      headers are not supported but a header value can contain commas. Cloud
      Tasks sets some headers to default values: * `User-Agent`: By default,
      this header is `"AppEngine-Google;
      (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"`. This header can be modified, but
      Cloud Tasks will append `"AppEngine-Google;
      (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"` to the modified `User-Agent`. If
      the task has a payload, Cloud Tasks sets the following headers: *
      `Content-Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to
      `"application/octet-stream"`. The default can be overridden by
      explicitly setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the
      task is created. For example, `Content-Type` can be set to
      `"application/json"`. * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud
      Tasks. This value is output only. It cannot be changed. The headers
      below cannot be set or overridden: * `Host` * `X-Google-*` *
      `X-AppEngine-*` In addition, Cloud Tasks sets some headers when the task
      is dispatched, such as headers containing information about the task;
      see [request headers](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tas
      kqueue/push/creating-handlers#reading_request_headers). These headers
      are set only when the task is dispatched, so they are not visible when
      the task is returned in a Cloud Tasks response. Although there is no
      specific limit for the maximum number of headers or the size, there is a
      limit on the maximum size of the Task. For more information, see the
      CreateTask documentation.

  Fields:
    appEngineRouting: Task-level setting for App Engine routing. If set,

      Handled](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/how-
      requests-are-handled).
    payload: Payload. The payload will be sent as the HTTP message body. A
      message body, and thus a payload, is allowed only if the HTTP method is
      POST or PUT. It is an error to set a data payload on a task with an
      incompatible HttpMethod.
    relativeUrl: The relative URL. The relative URL must begin with "/" and
      must be a valid HTTP relative URL. It can contain a path and query
      string arguments. If the relative URL is empty, then the root path "/"
      will be used. No spaces are allowed, and the maximum length allowed is
      2083 characters.

      specified then the system will generate a random unique task id, which
      will be set in the task returned in the response. If schedule_time is
      not set or is in the past then Cloud Tasks will set it to the current

      de-duplication. If a task's ID is identical to that of an existing task
      or a task that was deleted or completed recently then the call will fail
      with ALREADY_EXISTS. The IDs of deleted tasks are not immediately

      queue was created using a queue.yaml or queue.xml) for the task ID to be

      to identify duplicate task names, these CreateTask calls have
      significantly increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or
      for the prefix of the task id is recommended. Choosing task ids that are
      sequential or have sequential prefixes, for example using a timestamp,
      causes an increase in latency and error rates in all task commands. The

  Fields:
    filter: `filter` can be used to specify a subset of tasks to lease. When
      `filter` is set to `tag=` then the response will contain only tasks
      whose tag is equal to ``. `` must be less than 500 characters. When
      `filter` is set to `tag_function=oldest_tag()`, only tasks which have
      the same tag as the task with the oldest schedule_time will be returned.
      Grammar Syntax: * `filter = "tag=" tag | "tag_function=" function` *
      `tag = string` * `function = "oldest_tag()"` The `oldest_tag()` function
      returns tasks which have the same tag as the oldest task (ordered by

      d/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/taskqueue/TaskOptions.html#tag-
      byte:A-), only UTF-8 encoded tags can be used in Cloud Tasks. Tag which
      aren't UTF-8 encoded can't be used in the filter and the task's tag will
      be displayed as empty in Cloud Tasks.
    leaseDuration: Required. The duration of the lease. Each task returned in
      the response will have its schedule_time set to the current time plus
      the `lease_duration`. The task is leased until its schedule_time; thus,
      the task will not be returned to another LeaseTasks call before its
      schedule_time. After the worker has successfully finished the work
      associated with the task, the worker must call via AcknowledgeTask
      before the schedule_time. Otherwise the task will be returned to a later
      LeaseTasks call so that another worker can retry it. The maximum lease
      duration is 1 week. `lease_duration` will be truncated to the nearest
      second.
    maxTasks: The maximum number of tasks to lease. The system will make a
      best effort to return as close to as `max_tasks` as possible. The
      largest that `max_tasks` can be is 1000. The maximum total size of a
      lease tasks response is 32 MB. If the sum of all task sizes requested
      reaches this limit, fewer tasks than requested are returned.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).

      if the queue has never been purged.
    rateLimits: Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config
      are related because they both control task attempts however they control
      how tasks are attempted in different ways: * rate_limits controls the
      total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from
      the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or
      a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task
      after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task
      retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc).
    retryConfig: Settings that determine the retry behavior. * For tasks
      created using Cloud Tasks: the queue-level retry settings apply to all
      tasks in the queue that were created using Cloud Tasks. Retry settings
      cannot be set on individual tasks. * For tasks created using the App

    taskTtl: The maximum amount of time that a task will be retained in this
      queue. Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default `task_ttl` of 31
      days. After a task has lived for `task_ttl`, the task will be deleted

  Fields:
    maxBurstSize: The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in
      queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is
      high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing
      starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage
      when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token
      bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to
      control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that
      holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time
      a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be
      dispatched until the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will

      max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is
      picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second.
      The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that

      equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/
