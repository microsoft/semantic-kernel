  Fields:
    architecture: [Output Only] The architecture of the attached disk. Valid
      values are ARM64 or X86_64.
    autoDelete: Specifies whether the disk will be auto-deleted when the
      instance is deleted (but not when the disk is detached from the
      instance).
    boot: Indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machine will use the
      first partition of the disk for its root filesystem.
    deviceName: Specifies a unique device name of your choice that is
      reflected into the /dev/disk/by-id/google-* tree of a Linux operating
      system running within the instance. This name can be used to reference
      the device for mounting, resizing, and so on, from within the instance.

      new disk using an encryption key that you provide. If you are attaching
      an existing disk that is already encrypted, this field decrypts the disk
      using the customer-supplied encryption key. If you encrypt a disk using
      a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same key again when you
      attempt to use this resource at a later time. For example, you must
      provide the key when you create a snapshot or an image from the disk or
      when you attach the disk to a virtual machine instance. If you do not
      provide an encryption key, then the disk will be encrypted using an
      automatically generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use
      the disk later. Instance templates do not store customer-supplied
      encryption keys, so you cannot use your own keys to encrypt disks in a
      managed instance group.
    diskSizeGb: The size of the disk in GB.
    forceAttach: [Input Only] Whether to force attach the regional disk even
      if it's currently attached to another instance. If you try to force
      attach a zonal disk to an instance, you will receive an error.
    guestOsFeatures: A list of features to enable on the guest operating
      system. Applicable only for bootable images. Read Enabling guest
      operating system features to see a list of available options.
    index: [Output Only] A zero-based index to this disk, where 0 is reserved
      for the boot disk. If you have many disks attached to an instance, each
      disk would have a unique index number.
    initializeParams: [Input Only] Specifies the parameters for a new disk
      that will be created alongside the new instance. Use initialization
      parameters to create boot disks or local SSDs attached to the new
      instance. This property is mutually exclusive with the source property;
      you can only define one or the other, but not both.

      SCSI. Local SSDs can use either NVME or SCSI. In certain configurations,
      persistent disks can use NVMe. For more information, see About
      persistent disks.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#attachedDisk for
      attached disks.
    licenses: [Output Only] Any valid publicly visible licenses.
    mode: The mode in which to attach this disk, either READ_WRITE or

  Enums:
    UtilizationTargetTypeValueValuesEnum: Defines how target utilization value
      is expressed for a Stackdriver Monitoring metric. Either GAUGE,
      DELTA_PER_SECOND, or DELTA_PER_MINUTE.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter string, compatible with a Stackdriver Monitoring filter
      string for TimeSeries.list API call. This filter is used to select a
      specific TimeSeries for the purpose of autoscaling and to determine
      whether the metric is exporting per-instance or per-group data. For the
      filter to be valid for autoscaling purposes, the following rules apply:
      - You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors. - You can
      only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without any functions
      for each selector. - You can specify the metric in both the filter
      string and in the metric field. However, if specified in both places,
      the metric must be identical. - The monitored resource type determines
      what kind of values are expected for the metric. If it is a
      gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to include a separate
      TimeSeries for each instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot
      filter on resource labels. If the resource type is any other value, the
      autoscaler expects this metric to contain values that apply to the
      entire autoscaled instance group and resource label filtering can be
      performed to point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
      This is called a *per-group metric* for the purpose of autoscaling. If
      not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance. Try to provide a
      filter that is selective enough to pick just one TimeSeries for the
      autoscaled group or for each of the instances (if you are using
      gce_instance resource type). If multiple TimeSeries are returned upon
      the query execution, the autoscaler will sum their respective values to
      obtain its scaling value.
    metric: The identifier (type) of the Stackdriver Monitoring metric. The
      metric cannot have negative values. The metric must have a value type of
      INT64 or DOUBLE.
    singleInstanceAssignment: If scaling is based on a per-group metric value
      that represents the total amount of work to be done or resource usage,
      set this value to an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled
      group. Autoscaler keeps the number of instances proportional to the
      value of this metric. The metric itself does not change value due to
      group resizing. A good metric to use with the target is for example
      pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages or a custom
      metric exporting the total number of requests coming to your instances.
      A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median latency,
      since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a single instance,
      it could be better used with utilization_target instead.
    utilizationTarget: The target value of the metric that autoscaler
      maintains. This must be a positive value. A utilization metric scales
      number of virtual machines handling requests to increase or decrease
      proportionally to the metric. For example, a good metric to use as a
      utilization_target is https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/instance/net
      work/received_bytes_count. The autoscaler works to keep this value
      constant for each of the instances.

  Enums:
    CacheModeValueValuesEnum: Specifies the cache setting for all responses
      from this backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires
      the origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses
      without these headers will not be cached at Google's edge, and will
      require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially
      impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server.
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or
      "no-cache" directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this
      may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable)
      content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including
      common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets
      (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as
      uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be
      cached.

  Fields:
    bypassCacheOnRequestHeaders: Bypass the cache when the specified request
      headers are matched - e.g. Pragma or Authorization headers. Up to 5
      headers can be specified. The cache is bypassed for all
      cdnPolicy.cacheMode settings.
    cacheKeyPolicy: The CacheKeyPolicy for this CdnPolicy.
    cacheMode: Specifies the cache setting for all responses from this
      backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires the origin
      to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses without these
      headers will not be cached at Google's edge, and will require a full
      trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting performance
      and increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all
      content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or "no-cache" directives in
      Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN
      caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC
      Automatically cache static content, including common image formats,
      media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests
      and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content
      (including HTML), will not be cached.
    clientTtl: Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum TTL.
      This is used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value sent to the client.
      With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used
      for the response max-age directive, along with a "public" directive. For
      cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-
      age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age
      directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also
      ensures a "public" cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL
      is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum
      allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).
    defaultTtl: Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this
      origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or
      s-max-age). Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The value of
      defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can
      be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL
      will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value
      is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may
      be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    maxTtl: Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by
      this origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage
      higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the
      future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of
      an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not
      be modified. Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The maximum
      allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed
      objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    negativeCaching: Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set,
      in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects.
      This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience
      by reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to
      CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to
      responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control,
      Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the
      specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default,
      Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes:
      HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404
      (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP
      405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not
      Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be overridden in
      negative_caching_policy.
    negativeCachingPolicy: Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status
      code. negative_caching must be enabled to configure
      negative_caching_policy. Omitting the policy and leaving
      negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN's default cache TTLs. Note
      that when specifying an explicit negative_caching_policy, you should
      take care to specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to
      cache. Cloud CDN will not apply any default negative caching when a
      policy exists.
    requestCoalescing: If true then Cloud CDN will combine multiple concurrent
      cache fill requests into a small number of requests to the origin.
    serveWhileStale: Serve existing content from the cache (if available) when
      revalidating content with the origin, or when an error is encountered
      when refreshing the cache. This setting defines the default "max-stale"
      duration for any cached responses that do not specify a max-stale
      directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL configured here will not
      be served. The default limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will
      allow stale content to be served up to this limit beyond the max-age (or
      s-max-age) of a cached response. The maximum allowed value is 604800 (1
      week). Set this to zero (0) to disable serve-while-stale.
    signedUrlCacheMaxAgeSec: Maximum number of seconds the response to a
      signed URL request will be considered fresh. After this time period, the
      response will be revalidated before being served. Defaults to 1hr
      (3600s). When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will
      internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a
      "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any
      existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in responses
      will not be altered.

  Fields:
    affinityCookieTtlSec: Lifetime of cookies in seconds. This setting is
      applicable to Application Load Balancers and Traffic Director and
      requires GENERATED_COOKIE or HTTP_COOKIE session affinity. If set to 0,
      the cookie is non-persistent and lasts only until the end of the browser
      session (or equivalent). The maximum allowed value is two weeks
      (1,209,600). Not supported when the backend service is referenced by a
      URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless
      field set to true.
    backends: The list of backends that serve this BackendService.
    cdnPolicy: Cloud CDN configuration for this BackendService. Only available
      for specified load balancer types.
    circuitBreakers: A CircuitBreakers attribute.
    compressionMode: Compress text responses using Brotli or gzip compression,
      based on the client's Accept-Encoding header.
    connectionDraining: A ConnectionDraining attribute.
    connectionTrackingPolicy: Connection Tracking configuration for this
      BackendService. Connection tracking policy settings are only available
      for external passthrough Network Load Balancers and internal passthrough
      Network Load Balancers.
    consistentHash: Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to
      provide soft session affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other
      properties. This load balancing policy is applicable only for HTTP
      connections. The affinity to a particular destination host will be lost
      when one or more hosts are added/removed from the destination service.
      This field specifies parameters that control consistent hashing. This
      field is only applicable when localityLbPolicy is set to MAGLEV or
      RING_HASH. This field is applicable to either: - A regional backend
      service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and
      load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED. - A global backend
      service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    customRequestHeaders: Headers that the load balancer adds to proxied
      requests. See [Creating custom headers](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/custom-headers).
    customResponseHeaders: Headers that the load balancer adds to proxied
      responses. See [Creating custom headers](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/custom-headers).
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    edgeSecurityPolicy: [Output Only] The resource URL for the edge security
      policy associated with this backend service.
    enableCDN: If true, enables Cloud CDN for the backend service of a global
      external Application Load Balancer.
    failoverPolicy: Requires at least one backend instance group to be defined
      as a backup (failover) backend. For load balancers that have
      configurable failover: [Internal passthrough Network Load
      Balancers](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/internal/failover-overview) and [external passthrough
      Network Load Balancers](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/network/networklb-failover-overview).
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a BackendService. An up-to-date
      fingerprint must be provided in order to update the BackendService,
      otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see
      the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a
      BackendService.
    healthChecks: The list of URLs to the healthChecks, httpHealthChecks
      (legacy), or httpsHealthChecks (legacy) resource for health checking
      this backend service. Not all backend services support legacy health
      checks. See Load balancer guide. Currently, at most one health check can
      be specified for each backend service. Backend services with instance
      group or zonal NEG backends must have a health check. Backend services
      with internet or serverless NEG backends must not have a health check.
    iap: The configurations for Identity-Aware Proxy on this resource. Not
      available for internal passthrough Network Load Balancers and external
      passthrough Network Load Balancers.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#backendService for
      backend services.
    loadBalancingScheme: Specifies the load balancer type. A backend service
      created for one type of load balancer cannot be used with another. For
      more information, refer to Choosing a load balancer.
    localityLbPolicies: A list of locality load-balancing policies to be used
      in order of preference. When you use localityLbPolicies, you must set at
      least one value for either the localityLbPolicies[].policy or the
      localityLbPolicies[].customPolicy field. localityLbPolicies overrides
      any value set in the localityLbPolicy field. For an example of how to
      use this field, see Define a list of preferred policies. Caution: This
      field and its children are intended for use in a service mesh that
      includes gRPC clients only. Envoy proxies can't use backend services
      that have this configuration.
    localityLbPolicy: The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of
      the locality. The possible values are: - ROUND_ROBIN: This is a simple
      policy in which each healthy backend is selected in round robin order.
      This is the default. - LEAST_REQUEST: An O(1) algorithm which selects
      two random healthy hosts and picks the host which has fewer active
      requests. - RING_HASH: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements
      consistent hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
      addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the
      requests. - RANDOM: The load balancer selects a random healthy host. -
      ORIGINAL_DESTINATION: Backend host is selected based on the client
      connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to the same address as
      the destination address of the incoming connection before the connection
      was redirected to the load balancer. - MAGLEV: used as a drop in
      replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is not as stable as
      ring hash but has faster table lookup build times and host selection
      times. For more information about Maglev, see
      https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824 This field is applicable to
      either: - A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to
      HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and load_balancing_scheme set to
      INTERNAL_MANAGED. - A global backend service with the
      load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, INTERNAL_MANAGED, or
      EXTERNAL_MANAGED. If sessionAffinity is not NONE, and this field is not
      set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH, session affinity settings will not take
      effect. Only ROUND_ROBIN and RING_HASH are supported when the backend
      service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy
      that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
    logConfig: This field denotes the logging options for the load balancer
      traffic served by this backend service. If logging is enabled, logs will
      be exported to Stackdriver.
    maxStreamDuration: Specifies the default maximum duration (timeout) for
      streams to this service. Duration is computed from the beginning of the
      stream until the response has been completely processed, including all
      retries. A stream that does not complete in this duration is closed. If
      not specified, there will be no timeout limit, i.e. the maximum duration
      is infinite. This value can be overridden in the PathMatcher
      configuration of the UrlMap that references this backend service. This
      field is only allowed when the loadBalancingScheme of the backend
      service is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    metadatas: Deployment metadata associated with the resource to be set by a
      GKE hub controller and read by the backend RCTH
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    network: The URL of the network to which this backend service belongs.
      This field can only be specified when the load balancing scheme is set
      to INTERNAL.
    outlierDetection: Settings controlling the ejection of unhealthy backend
      endpoints from the load balancing pool of each individual proxy instance
      that processes the traffic for the given backend service. If not set,
      this feature is considered disabled. Results of the outlier detection
      algorithm (ejection of endpoints from the load balancing pool and
      returning them back to the pool) are executed independently by each
      proxy instance of the load balancer. In most cases, more than one proxy
      instance handles the traffic received by a backend service. Thus, it is
      possible that an unhealthy endpoint is detected and ejected by only some
      of the proxies, and while this happens, other proxies may continue to
      send requests to the same unhealthy endpoint until they detect and eject
      the unhealthy endpoint. Applicable backend endpoints can be: - VM
      instances in an Instance Group - Endpoints in a Zonal NEG (GCE_VM_IP,
      GCE_VM_IP_PORT) - Endpoints in a Hybrid Connectivity NEG
      (NON_GCP_PRIVATE_IP_PORT) - Serverless NEGs, that resolve to Cloud Run,
      App Engine, or Cloud Functions Services - Private Service Connect NEGs,
      that resolve to Google-managed regional API endpoints or managed
      services published using Private Service Connect Applicable backend
      service types can be: - A global backend service with the
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or EXTERNAL_MANAGED. -
      A regional backend service with the serviceProtocol set to HTTP, HTTPS,
      or HTTP2, and loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED or
      EXTERNAL_MANAGED. Not supported for Serverless NEGs. Not supported when
      the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target
      gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
    port: Deprecated in favor of portName. The TCP port to connect on the
      backend. The default value is 80. For internal passthrough Network Load
      Balancers and external passthrough Network Load Balancers, omit port.
    portName: A named port on a backend instance group representing the port
      for communication to the backend VMs in that group. The named port must
      be [defined on each backend instance
      group](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-
      service#named_ports). This parameter has no meaning if the backends are
      NEGs. For internal passthrough Network Load Balancers and external
      passthrough Network Load Balancers, omit port_name.
    protocol: The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with
      backends. Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2, TCP, SSL, UDP or GRPC.
      depending on the chosen load balancer or Traffic Director configuration.
      Refer to the documentation for the load balancers or for Traffic
      Director for more information. Must be set to GRPC when the backend
      service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional backend service
      resides. This field is not applicable to global backend services. You
      must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not
      settable as a field in the request body.
    securityPolicy: [Output Only] The resource URL for the security policy
      associated with this backend service.
    securitySettings: This field specifies the security settings that apply to
      this backend service. This field is applicable to a global backend
      service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    serviceBindings: URLs of networkservices.ServiceBinding resources. Can
      only be set if load balancing scheme is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. If set,
      lists of backends and health checks must be both empty.
    serviceLbPolicy: URL to networkservices.ServiceLbPolicy resource. Can only
      be set if load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED,
      INTERNAL_MANAGED or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED and the scope is global.
    sessionAffinity: Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE.
      Only NONE and HEADER_FIELD are supported when the backend service is
      referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true. For more details, see: [Session
      Affinity](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-
      service#session_affinity).
    subsetting: A Subsetting attribute.
    timeoutSec: The backend service timeout has a different meaning depending
      on the type of load balancer. For more information see, Backend service
      settings. The default is 30 seconds. The full range of timeout values
      allowed goes from 1 through 2,147,483,647 seconds. This value can be
      overridden in the PathMatcher configuration of the UrlMap that
      references this backend service. Not supported when the backend service
      is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true. Instead, use maxStreamDuration.
    usedBy: A BackendServiceUsedBy attribute.

  r"""Message containing Cloud CDN configuration for a backend service.

  Enums:
    CacheModeValueValuesEnum: Specifies the cache setting for all responses
      from this backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires
      the origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses
      without these headers will not be cached at Google's edge, and will
      require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially
      impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server.
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or
      "no-cache" directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this
      may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable)
      content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including
      common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets
      (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as
      uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be
      cached.

  Fields:
    bypassCacheOnRequestHeaders: Bypass the cache when the specified request
      headers are matched - e.g. Pragma or Authorization headers. Up to 5
      headers can be specified. The cache is bypassed for all
      cdnPolicy.cacheMode settings.
    cacheKeyPolicy: The CacheKeyPolicy for this CdnPolicy.
    cacheMode: Specifies the cache setting for all responses from this
      backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires the origin
      to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses without these
      headers will not be cached at Google's edge, and will require a full
      trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting performance
      and increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all
      content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or "no-cache" directives in
      Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN
      caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC
      Automatically cache static content, including common image formats,
      media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests
      and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content
      (including HTML), will not be cached.
    clientTtl: Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum TTL.
      This is used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value sent to the client.
      With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used
      for the response max-age directive, along with a "public" directive. For
      cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-
      age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age
      directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also
      ensures a "public" cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL
      is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum
      allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).
    defaultTtl: Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this
      origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or
      s-max-age). Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The value of
      defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can
      be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL
      will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value
      is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may
      be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    maxTtl: Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by
      this origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage
      higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the
      future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of
      an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not
      be modified. Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The maximum
      allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed
      objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    negativeCaching: Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set,
      in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects.
      This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience
      by reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to
      CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to
      responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control,
      Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the
      specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default,
      Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes:
      HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404
      (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP
      405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not
      Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be overridden in
      negative_caching_policy.
    negativeCachingPolicy: Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status
      code. negative_caching must be enabled to configure
      negative_caching_policy. Omitting the policy and leaving
      negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN's default cache TTLs. Note
      that when specifying an explicit negative_caching_policy, you should
      take care to specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to
      cache. Cloud CDN will not apply any default negative caching when a
      policy exists.
    requestCoalescing: If true then Cloud CDN will combine multiple concurrent
      cache fill requests into a small number of requests to the origin.
    serveWhileStale: Serve existing content from the cache (if available) when
      revalidating content with the origin, or when an error is encountered
      when refreshing the cache. This setting defines the default "max-stale"
      duration for any cached responses that do not specify a max-stale
      directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL configured here will not
      be served. The default limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will
      allow stale content to be served up to this limit beyond the max-age (or
      s-max-age) of a cached response. The maximum allowed value is 604800 (1
      week). Set this to zero (0) to disable serve-while-stale.
    signedUrlCacheMaxAgeSec: Maximum number of seconds the response to a
      signed URL request will be considered fresh. After this time period, the
      response will be revalidated before being served. Defaults to 1hr
      (3600s). When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will
      internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a
      "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any
      existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in responses
      will not be altered.
    signedUrlKeyNames: [Output Only] Names of the keys for signing request
      URLs.

      LEAST_REQUEST: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy hosts
        and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
      MAGLEV: This algorithm implements consistent hashing to backends. Maglev
        can be used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
        Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup build
        times and host selection times. For more information about Maglev, see
        https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
      ORIGINAL_DESTINATION: Backend host is selected based on the client
        connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to the same address
        as the destination address of the incoming connection before the
        connection was redirected to the load balancer.
      RANDOM: The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
      RING_HASH: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
        hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
        addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of
        the requests.
      ROUND_ROBIN: This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend is
        selected in round robin order. This is the default.
      WEIGHTED_MAGLEV: Per-instance weighted Load Balancing via health check
        reported weights. If set, the Backend Service must configure a non
        legacy HTTP-based Health Check, and health check replies are expected
        to contain non-standard HTTP response header field X-Load-Balancing-
        Endpoint-Weight to specify the per-instance weights. If set, Load
        Balancing is weighted based on the per-instance weights reported in
        the last processed health check replies, as long as every instance
        either reported a valid weight or had UNAVAILABLE_WEIGHT. Otherwise,
        Load Balancing remains equal-weight. This option is only supported in

    minCount: The minimum number of instances to create. If no min_count is

      instances cannot be created, then no instances will be created and
      instances already created will be deleted.
    namePattern: The string pattern used for the names of the VMs. Either
      name_pattern or per_instance_properties must be set. The pattern must
      contain one continuous sequence of placeholder hash characters (#) with
      each character corresponding to one digit of the generated instance
      name. Example: a name_pattern of inst-#### generates instance names such
      as inst-0001 and inst-0002. If existing instances in the same project
      and zone have names that match the name pattern then the generated
      instance numbers start after the biggest existing number. For example,
      if there exists an instance with name inst-0050, then instance names

      instanceProperties to override specific values from an existing instance
      template. Bulk API follows the semantics of JSON Merge Patch described

class ComputeAcceleratorTypesAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeAcceleratorTypesAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no

class ComputeAutoscalersAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeAutoscalersAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no

class ComputeBackendServicesAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeBackendServicesAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Name of the project scoping this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.
    serviceProjectNumber: The Shared VPC service project id or service project
      number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks
      list-usable api.

class ComputeDiskTypesAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeDiskTypesAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.

      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.

class ComputeExternalVpnGatewaysListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeExternalVpnGatewaysListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double

class ComputeFirewallPoliciesListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeFirewallPoliciesListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    parentId: Parent ID for this request. The ID can be either be
      "folders/[FOLDER_ID]" if the parent is a folder or
      "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]" if the parent is an organization.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no

class ComputeForwardingRulesListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeForwardingRulesListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

class ComputeGlobalNetworkEndpointGroupsListNetworkEndpointsRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeGlobalNetworkEndpointGroupsListNetworkEndpointsRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    networkEndpointGroup: The name of the network endpoint group from which
      you want to generate a list of included network endpoints. It should
      comply with RFC1035.
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be

  r"""A ComputeHttpHealthChecksListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.

      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.

class ComputeInstanceGroupManagersListErrorsRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeInstanceGroupManagersListErrorsRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    instanceGroupManager: The name of the managed instance group. It must be a
      string that meets the requirements in RFC1035, or an unsigned long
      integer: must match regexp pattern:
      (?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)|1-9{0,19}.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.

class ComputeInstanceGroupsAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeInstanceGroupsAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.

      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Name of the project scoping this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.
    serviceProjectNumber: The Shared VPC service project id or service project
      number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks
      list-usable api.

class ComputeInstancesListReferrersRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeInstancesListReferrersRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    instance: Name of the target instance scoping this request, or '-' if the
      request should span over all instances in the container.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.

class ComputeInstantSnapshotsAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeInstantSnapshotsAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.

class ComputeInterconnectAttachmentsListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeInterconnectAttachmentsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    region: Name of the region for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides

      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no

class ComputeLicensesListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeLicensesListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.

      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.
    serviceProjectNumber: The Shared VPC service project id or service project
      number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks
      list-usable api.

class ComputeNetworkEndpointGroupsListNetworkEndpointsRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeNetworkEndpointGroupsListNetworkEndpointsRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    networkEndpointGroup: The name of the network endpoint group from which
      you want to generate a list of included network endpoints. It should
      comply with RFC1035.
    networkEndpointGroupsListEndpointsRequest: A
      NetworkEndpointGroupsListEndpointsRequest resource to be passed as the

      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For

      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.

    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:

      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=

class ComputeNodeGroupsAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeNodeGroupsAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.
    serviceProjectNumber: The Shared VPC service project id or service project
      number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks

class ComputeNodeTemplatesAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeNodeTemplatesAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no

class ComputePacketMirroringsListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputePacketMirroringsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable

class ComputePublicAdvertisedPrefixesListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputePublicAdvertisedPrefixesListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For

class ComputeRegionAutoscalersListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRegionAutoscalersListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For

class ComputeRegionCommitmentsAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRegionCommitmentsAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no

class ComputeRegionDisksListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRegionDisksListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    region: Name of the region for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For

class ComputeRegionHealthChecksListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRegionHealthChecksListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    region: Name of the region scoping this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no

      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    instanceGroupManager: The name of the managed instance group.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    region: Name of the region scoping this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no

      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For

      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can

class ComputeRegionInstanceGroupsListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRegionInstanceGroupsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    region: Name of the region scoping this request.

class ComputeRegionNetworkEndpointGroupsListNetworkEndpointsRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRegionNetworkEndpointGroupsListNetworkEndpointsRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    networkEndpointGroup: The name of the network endpoint group from which
      you want to generate a list of included network endpoints. It should
      comply with RFC1035.
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    region: The name of the region where the network endpoint group is
      located. It should comply with RFC1035.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no

class ComputeRegionNotificationEndpointsListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRegionNotificationEndpointsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)

      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource

  r"""A ComputeRegionTargetHttpProxiesListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.

  r"""A ComputeRegionUrlMapsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    region: Name of the region scoping this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides

      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can

      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope

class ComputeRoutersGetNatMappingInfoRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRoutersGetNatMappingInfoRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    natName: Name of the nat service to filter the Nat Mapping information. If
      it is omitted, all nats for this router will be returned. Name should
      conform to RFC1035.
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    region: Name of the region for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides

  r"""A ComputeSecurityPoliciesListPreconfiguredExpressionSetsRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2

class ComputeSslPoliciesAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeSslPoliciesAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Name of the project scoping this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.
    serviceProjectNumber: The Shared VPC service project id or service project
      number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks
      list-usable api.

class ComputeStoragePoolsAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeStoragePoolsAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.

  r"""A ComputeSubnetworksListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your

      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to

      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND

      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2

class ComputeTargetInstancesAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeTargetInstancesAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.

class ComputeTargetPoolsListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeTargetPoolsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    region: Name of the region scoping this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no

  r"""A ComputeTargetTcpProxiesAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on

      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Name of the project scoping this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no

class ComputeUrlMapsAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeUrlMapsAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions
      cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Name of the project scoping this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no

      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key
      has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label
      use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For
      example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to
      include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts.
      You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource
      labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate
      expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.

      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular
      expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a
      single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against
      multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted
      literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double
      quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The
      literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2
      library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For
      example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
      you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on
      multiple fields using regular expressions.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For
      example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
      single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no
      resources, with an error code.

    diskEncryptionKey: Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption
      key or a customer-managed encryption key. Encryption keys do not protect
      access to metadata of the disk. After you encrypt a disk with a

    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    options: Internal use only.

      future. If an unsupported value is requested, the error message will
      list the supported values for the caller's project.
    provisionedIops: Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This
      sets the number of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle.
      Values must be between 10,000 and 120,000. For more details, see the
      Extreme persistent disk documentation.
    provisionedThroughput: Indicates how much throughput to provision for the
      disk. This sets the number of throughput mb per second that the disk can
      handle. Values must be greater than or equal to 1.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the disk resides. Only
      applicable for regional resources. You must specify this field as part

      body.
    replicaZones: URLs of the zones where the disk should be replicated to.
      Only applicable for regional resources.
    resourcePolicies: Resource policies applied to this disk for automatic
      snapshot creations.
    resourceStatus: [Output Only] Status information for the disk resource.
    satisfiesPzi: Output only. Reserved for future use.
    satisfiesPzs: [Output Only] Reserved for future use.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined fully-qualified URL for this
      resource.
    sizeGb: Size, in GB, of the persistent disk. You can specify this field
      when creating a persistent disk using the sourceImage, sourceSnapshot,
      or sourceDisk parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty
      persistent disk. If you specify this field along with a source, the
      value of sizeGb must not be less than the size of the source. Acceptable
      values are greater than 0.
    sourceConsistencyGroupPolicy: [Output Only] URL of the
      DiskConsistencyGroupPolicy for a secondary disk that was created using a
      consistency group.
    sourceConsistencyGroupPolicyId: [Output Only] ID of the
      DiskConsistencyGroupPolicy for a secondary disk that was created using a
      consistency group.
    sourceDisk: The source disk used to create this disk. You can provide this
      as a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the following are

      regions/region/disks/disk
    sourceDiskId: [Output Only] The unique ID of the disk used to create this
      disk. This value identifies the exact disk that was used to create this
      persistent disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from a
      disk that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the
      source disk ID would identify the exact version of the disk that was
      used.
    sourceImage: The source image used to create this disk. If the source
      image is deleted, this field will not be set. To create a disk with one
      of the public operating system images, specify the image by its family
      name. For example, specify family/debian-9 to use the latest Debian 9
      image: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9
      Alternatively, use a specific version of a public operating system
      image: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-vYYYYMMDD To
      create a disk with a custom image that you created, specify the image
      name in the following format: global/images/my-custom-image You can also
      specify a custom image by its image family, which returns the latest
      version of the image in that family. Replace the image name with
      family/family-name: global/images/family/my-image-family
    sourceImageEncryptionKey: The customer-supplied encryption key of the
      source image. Required if the source image is protected by a customer-
      supplied encryption key.
    sourceImageId: [Output Only] The ID value of the image used to create this
      disk. This value identifies the exact image that was used to create this
      persistent disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from an
      image that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the
      source image ID would identify the exact version of the image that was
      used.
    sourceInstantSnapshot: The source instant snapshot used to create this
      disk. You can provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. For
      example, the following are valid values: -

    sourceInstantSnapshotId: [Output Only] The unique ID of the instant
      snapshot used to create this disk. This value identifies the exact
      instant snapshot that was used to create this persistent disk. For
      example, if you created the persistent disk from an instant snapshot
      that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
      instant snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the instant
      snapshot that was used.
    sourceSnapshot: The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can
      provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the
      following are valid values: -
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project
      /global/snapshots/snapshot - projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot
      - global/snapshots/snapshot
    sourceSnapshotEncryptionKey: The customer-supplied encryption key of the
      source snapshot. Required if the source snapshot is protected by a
      customer-supplied encryption key.
    sourceSnapshotId: [Output Only] The unique ID of the snapshot used to
      create this disk. This value identifies the exact snapshot that was used
      to create this persistent disk. For example, if you created the
      persistent disk from a snapshot that was later deleted and recreated
      under the same name, the source snapshot ID would identify the exact
      version of the snapshot that was used.
    sourceStorageObject: The full Google Cloud Storage URI where the disk
      image is stored. This file must be a gzip-compressed tarball whose name
      ends in .tar.gz or virtual machine disk whose name ends in vmdk. Valid
      URIs may start with gs:// or https://storage.googleapis.com/. This flag
      is not optimized for creating multiple disks from a source storage
      object. To create many disks from a source storage object, use gcloud
      compute images import instead.

      DELETING: Disk is deleting.
    storagePool: The storage pool in which the new disk is created. You can
      provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the
      following are valid values: -
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone
      /storagePools/storagePool -
      projects/project/zones/zone/storagePools/storagePool -
      zones/zone/storagePools/storagePool
    type: URL of the disk type resource describing which disk type to use to
      create the disk. Provide this when creating the disk. For example:
      projects/project /zones/zone/diskTypes/pd-ssd . See Persistent disk
      types.
    users: [Output Only] Links to the users of the disk (attached instances)
      in form: projects/project/zones/zone/instances/instance
    zone: [Output Only] URL of the zone where the disk resides. You must

      connection.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    denied: The list of DENY rules specified by this firewall. Each rule
      specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a denied
      connection.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this field
      when you create the resource.
    destinationRanges: If destination ranges are specified, the firewall rule
      applies only to traffic that has destination IP address in these ranges.
      These ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are
      supported.
    direction: Direction of traffic to which this firewall applies, either
      `INGRESS` or `EGRESS`. The default is `INGRESS`. For `EGRESS` traffic,
      you cannot specify the sourceTags fields.
    disabled: Denotes whether the firewall rule is disabled. When set to true,
      the firewall rule is not enforced and the network behaves as if it did
      not exist. If this is unspecified, the firewall rule will be enabled.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#firewall for
      firewall rules.
    logConfig: This field denotes the logging options for a particular
      firewall rule. If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to Cloud
      Logging.
    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`. The first character
      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters (except for the
      last character) must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit. The last
      character must be a lowercase letter or digit.
    network: URL of the network resource for this firewall rule. If not
      specified when creating a firewall rule, the default network is used:
      global/networks/default If you choose to specify this field, you can
      specify the network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following
      are all valid URLs: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myp
      roject/global/networks/my-network -
      projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network - global/networks/default
    priority: Priority for this rule. This is an integer between `0` and
      `65535`, both inclusive. The default value is `1000`. Relative
      priorities determine which rule takes effect if multiple rules apply.
      Lower values indicate higher priority. For example, a rule with priority
      `0` has higher precedence than a rule with priority `1`. DENY rules take
      precedence over ALLOW rules if they have equal priority. Note that VPC
      networks have implied rules with a priority of `65535`. To avoid
      conflicts with the implied rules, use a priority number less than
      `65535`.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    sourceRanges: If source ranges are specified, the firewall rule applies
      only to traffic that has a source IP address in these ranges. These
      ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and
      sourceTags may be set. If both fields are set, the rule applies to
      traffic that has a source IP address within sourceRanges OR a source IP
      from a resource with a matching tag listed in the sourceTags field. The
      connection does not need to match both fields for the rule to apply.
      Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.
    sourceServiceAccounts: If source service accounts are specified, the
      firewall rules apply only to traffic originating from an instance with a
      service account in this list. Source service accounts cannot be used to
      control traffic to an instance's external IP address because service
      accounts are associated with an instance, not an IP address.
      sourceRanges can be set at the same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If
      both are set, the firewall applies to traffic that has a source IP
      address within the sourceRanges OR a source IP that belongs to an
      instance with service account listed in sourceServiceAccount. The
      connection does not need to match both fields for the firewall to apply.
      sourceServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as sourceTags or
      targetTags.
    sourceTags: If source tags are specified, the firewall rule applies only
      to traffic with source IPs that match the primary network interfaces of
      VM instances that have the tag and are in the same VPC network. Source
      tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP
      address, it only applies to traffic between instances in the same
      virtual network. Because tags are associated with instances, not IP
      addresses. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If
      both fields are set, the firewall applies to traffic that has a source
      IP address within sourceRanges OR a source IP from a resource with a
      matching tag listed in the sourceTags field. The connection does not
      need to match both fields for the firewall to apply.
    targetServiceAccounts: A list of service accounts indicating sets of
      instances located in the network that may make network connections as
      specified in allowed[]. targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same
      time as targetTags or sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor
      targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on
      the specified network.
    targetTags: A list of tags that controls which instances the firewall rule
      applies to. If targetTags are specified, then the firewall rule applies
      only to instances in the VPC network that have one of those tags. If no
      targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on
      the specified network.

  es) A forwarding rule and its corresponding IP address represent the
  frontend configuration of a Google Cloud load balancer. Forwarding rules can
  also reference target instances and Cloud VPN Classic gateways
  (targetVpnGateway). For more information, read Forwarding rule concepts and
  Using protocol forwarding.

  Enums:
    IPProtocolValueValuesEnum: The IP protocol to which this rule applies. For
      protocol forwarding, valid options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, ICMP and
      L3_DEFAULT. The valid IP protocols are different for different load
      balancing products as described in [Load balancing

      PREMIUM, STANDARD. For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are
      PREMIUM and STANDARD. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is
      PREMIUM. If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM. If
      IPAddress is specified, this value must be equal to the networkTier of
      the Address.
    PscConnectionStatusValueValuesEnum:

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified
      by the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.

  Fields:
    IPAddress: IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When
      a client sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs
      the traffic to the referenced target or backendService. While creating a
      forwarding rule, specifying an IPAddress is required under the following
      circumstances: - When the target is set to targetGrpcProxy and
      validateForProxyless is set to true, the IPAddress should be set to
      0.0.0.0. - When the target is a Private Service Connect Google APIs
      bundle, you must specify an IPAddress. Otherwise, you can optionally
      specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved) IP
      address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP
      address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while
      creating a forwarding rule: * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3` *
      IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96` * Full resource URL, as in
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/
      project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL or by
      name, as in: - projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name
      - regions/region/addresses/address-name - global/addresses/address-name
      - address-name The forwarding rule's target or backendService, and in
      most cases, also the loadBalancingScheme, determine the type of IP
      address that you can use. For detailed information, see [IP address
      specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-
      rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications). When reading an IPAddress, the
      API always returns the IP address number.
    IPProtocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies. For protocol
      forwarding, valid options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, ICMP and
      L3_DEFAULT. The valid IP protocols are different for different load
      balancing products as described in [Load balancing
      features](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#protocol
      s_from_the_load_balancer_to_the_backends).
    allPorts: The ports, portRange, and allPorts fields are mutually
      exclusive. Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will
      be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. The
      allPorts field has the following limitations: - It requires that the
      forwarding rule IPProtocol be TCP, UDP, SCTP, or L3_DEFAULT. - It's
      applicable only to the following products: internal passthrough Network
      Load Balancers, backend service-based external passthrough Network Load
      Balancers, and internal and external protocol forwarding. - Set this
      field to true to allow packets addressed to any port or packets lacking
      destination port information (for example, UDP fragments after the first
      fragment) to be forwarded to the backends configured with this
      forwarding rule. The L3_DEFAULT protocol requires allPorts be set to
      true.
    allowGlobalAccess: If set to true, clients can access the internal
      passthrough Network Load Balancers, the regional internal Application
      Load Balancer, and the regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer
      from all regions. If false, only allows access from the local region the
      load balancer is located at. Note that for INTERNAL_MANAGED forwarding
      rules, this field cannot be changed after the forwarding rule is
      created.
    allowPscGlobalAccess: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to
      control whether the PSC endpoint can be accessed from another region.
    backendService: Identifies the backend service to which the forwarding
      rule sends traffic. Required for internal and external passthrough
      Network Load Balancers; must be omitted for all other load balancer
      types.
    baseForwardingRule: [Output Only] The URL for the corresponding base
      forwarding rule. By base forwarding rule, we mean the forwarding rule
      that has the same IP address, protocol, and port settings with the
      current forwarding rule, but without sourceIPRanges specified. Always
      empty if the current forwarding rule does not have sourceIPRanges
      specified.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a ForwardingRule. Include the fingerprint
      in patch request to ensure that you do not overwrite changes that were
      applied from another concurrent request. To see the latest fingerprint,
      make a get() request to retrieve a ForwardingRule.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    ipVersion: The IP Version that will be used by this forwarding rule. Valid
      options are IPV4 or IPV6.
    isMirroringCollector: Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be
      used as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops,
      instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored
      even if a PacketMirroring rule applies to them. This can only be set to
      true for load balancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#forwardingRule
      for forwarding rule resources.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      resource, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve a ForwardingRule.
    labels: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by
      the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.
    loadBalancingScheme: Specifies the forwarding rule type. For more
      information about forwarding rules, refer to Forwarding rule concepts.
    metadataFilters: Opaque filter criteria used by load balancer to restrict
      routing configuration to a limited set of xDS compliant clients. In
      their xDS requests to load balancer, xDS clients present node metadata.
      When there is a match, the relevant configuration is made available to
      those proxies. Otherwise, all the resources (e.g. TargetHttpProxy,
      UrlMap) referenced by the ForwardingRule are not visible to those
      proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if its
      filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the
      filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the
      metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of
      its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the
      metadata. If multiple metadataFilters are specified, all of them need to
      be satisfied in order to be considered a match. metadataFilters
      specified here will be applifed before those specified in the UrlMap
      that this ForwardingRule references. metadataFilters only applies to
      Loadbalancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that
      forward traffic to Google APIs, the forwarding rule name must be a 1-20
      characters string with lowercase letters and numbers and must start with
      a letter.
    network: This field is not used for global external load balancing. For
      internal passthrough Network Load Balancers, this field identifies the
      network that the load balanced IP should belong to for this forwarding
      rule. If the subnetwork is specified, the network of the subnetwork will
      be used. If neither subnetwork nor this field is specified, the default
      network will be used. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that
      forward traffic to Google APIs, a network must be provided.
    networkTier: This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this
      load balancer and can only take the following values: PREMIUM, STANDARD.
      For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are PREMIUM and STANDARD.
      For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is PREMIUM. If this field is
      not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM. If IPAddress is specified,
      this value must be equal to the networkTier of the Address.
    noAutomateDnsZone: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control
      whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC
      forwarding rules do not use this field. Once set, this field is not
      mutable.
    portRange: The ports, portRange, and allPorts fields are mutually
      exclusive. Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will
      be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. The
      portRange field has the following limitations: - It requires that the
      forwarding rule IPProtocol be TCP, UDP, or SCTP, and - It's applicable
      only to the following products: external passthrough Network Load
      Balancers, internal and external proxy Network Load Balancers, internal
      and external Application Load Balancers, external protocol forwarding,
      and Classic VPN. - Some products have restrictions on what ports can be
      used. See port specifications for details. For external forwarding
      rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same [IPAddress,
      IPProtocol] pair, and cannot have overlapping portRanges. For internal
      forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more forwarding
      rules cannot use the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair, and cannot have
      overlapping portRanges. @pattern: \\d+(?:-\\d+)?
    ports: The ports, portRange, and allPorts fields are mutually exclusive.
      Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded
      to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. The ports field
      has the following limitations: - It requires that the forwarding rule
      IPProtocol be TCP, UDP, or SCTP, and - It's applicable only to the
      following products: internal passthrough Network Load Balancers, backend
      service-based external passthrough Network Load Balancers, and internal
      protocol forwarding. - You can specify a list of up to five ports by
      number, separated by commas. The ports can be contiguous or
      discontiguous. For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding
      rules cannot use the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair if they share at
      least one port number. For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC
      network, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same [IPAddress,
      IPProtocol] pair if they share at least one port number. @pattern:
      \\d+(?:-\\d+)?
    pscConnectionId: [Output Only] The PSC connection id of the PSC forwarding
      rule.
    pscConnectionStatus: A PscConnectionStatusValueValuesEnum attribute.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional forwarding rule
      resides. This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules. You
      must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not
      settable as a field in the request body.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    serviceDirectoryRegistrations: Service Directory resources to register
      this forwarding rule with. Currently, only supports a single Service
      Directory resource.
    serviceLabel: An optional prefix to the service name for this forwarding
      rule. If specified, the prefix is the first label of the fully qualified
      service name. The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
      must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character,
      which cannot be a dash. This field is only used for internal load
      balancing.
    serviceName: [Output Only] The internal fully qualified service name for
      this forwarding rule. This field is only used for internal load
      balancing.
    sourceIpRanges: If not empty, this forwarding rule will only forward the
      traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP addresses or
      CIDR ranges set here. Note that a forwarding rule can only have up to 64
      source IP ranges, and this field can only be used with a regional
      forwarding rule whose scheme is EXTERNAL. Each source_ip_range entry
      should be either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range
      (for example, 1.2.3.0/24).
    subnetwork: This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP
      should belong to for this forwarding rule, used with internal load
      balancers and external passthrough Network Load Balancers with IPv6. If
      the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional.
      However, a subnetwork must be specified if the network is in custom
      subnet mode or when creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.
    target: The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic. For
      regional forwarding rules, this target must be in the same region as the
      forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a
      global load balancing resource. The forwarded traffic must be of a type
      appropriate to the target object. - For load balancers, see the "Target"
      column in [Port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications). -
      For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
      Google APIs, provide the name of a supported Google API bundle: - vpc-sc
      - APIs that support VPC Service Controls. - all-apis - All supported
      Google APIs. - For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward
      traffic to managed services, the target must be a service attachment.
      The target is not mutable once set as a service attachment.

      supported when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy.
    faultInjectionPolicy: The specification for fault injection introduced
      into traffic to test the resiliency of clients to backend service
      failure. As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a
      backend service, delays can be introduced by a load balancer on a
      percentage of requests before sending those requests to the backend
      service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the load
      balancer for a percentage of requests. timeout and retry_policy is
      ignored by clients that are configured with a fault_injection_policy if:
      1. The traffic is generated by fault injection AND 2. The fault
      injection is not a delay fault injection. Fault injection is not
      supported with the classic Application Load Balancer . To see which load
      balancers support fault injection, see Load balancing: Routing and
      traffic management features.
    maxStreamDuration: Specifies the maximum duration (timeout) for streams on
      the selected route. Unlike the timeout field where the timeout duration
      starts from the time the request has been fully processed (known as
      *end-of-stream*), the duration in this field is computed from the

      all retries. A stream that does not complete in this duration is closed.

      among all backend services associated with the route. This field is only
      allowed if the Url map is used with backend services with
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    requestMirrorPolicy: Specifies the policy on how requests intended for the
      route's backends are shadowed to a separate mirrored backend service.
      The load balancer does not wait for responses from the shadow service.
      Before sending traffic to the shadow service, the host / authority
      header is suffixed with -shadow. Not supported when the URL map is bound
      to a target gRPC proxy that has the validateForProxyless field set to
      true.
    retryPolicy: Specifies the retry policy associated with this route.
    timeout: Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed
      from the time the request has been fully processed (known as *end-of-
      stream*) up until the response has been processed. Timeout includes all
      retries. If not specified, this field uses the largest timeout among all
      backend services associated with the route. Not supported when the URL
      map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field

    headerAction: Specifies changes to request and response headers that need
      to take effect for the selected backendService. The headerAction value
      specified here is applied before the matching
      pathMatchers[].headerAction and after pathMatchers[].routeRules[].routeA

      loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL. Not supported when the URL map is
      bound to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to
      true.
    matchRules: The list of criteria for matching attributes of a request to
      this routeRule. This list has OR semantics: the request matches this
      routeRule when any of the matchRules are satisfied. However predicates
      within a given matchRule have AND semantics. All predicates within a
      matchRule must match for the request to match the rule.
    priority: For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines
      the order in which a load balancer interprets routeRules. RouteRules are
      evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The
      priority of a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The
      first rule that matches the request is applied. You cannot configure two
      or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority for each rule must
      be set to a number from 0 to 2147483647 inclusive. Priority numbers can
      have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules in the future without
      affecting the rest of the rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16
      is a valid series of priority numbers to which you could add rules
      numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any
      impact on existing rules.
    routeAction: In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer
      performs advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header
      transformations, before forwarding the request to the selected backend.
      If routeAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, service must not
      be set. Conversely if service is set, routeAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Only one of urlRedirect, service or
      routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set. URL maps for classic
      Application Load Balancers only support the urlRewrite action within a
      route rule's routeAction.
    service: The full or partial URL of the backend service resource to which
      traffic is directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is also
      specified, advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites, take effect
      before sending the request to the backend. However, if service is
      specified, routeAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.
      Conversely, if routeAction specifies any weightedBackendServices,
      service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect, service or
      routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
    urlRedirect: When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL
      specified by urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service or
      routeAction must not be set. Not supported when the URL map is bound to
      a target gRPC proxy.

  Fields:
    fullPathMatch: For satisfying the matchRule condition, the path of the
      request must exactly match the value specified in fullPathMatch after
      removing any query parameters and anchor that may be part of the
      original URL. fullPathMatch must be from 1 to 1024 characters. Only one

    headerMatches: Specifies a list of header match criteria, all of which
      must match corresponding headers in the request.
    ignoreCase: Specifies that prefixMatch and fullPathMatch matches are case
      sensitive. The default value is false. ignoreCase must not be used with
      regexMatch. Not supported when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC
      proxy.
    metadataFilters: Opaque filter criteria used by the load balancer to
      restrict routing configuration to a limited set of xDS compliant
      clients. In their xDS requests to the load balancer, xDS clients present
      node metadata. When there is a match, the relevant routing configuration
      is made available to those proxies. For each metadataFilter in this
      list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of
      the filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the
      metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of
      its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the
      metadata. If multiple metadata filters are specified, all of them need
      to be satisfied in order to be considered a match. metadataFilters
      specified here is applied after those specified in ForwardingRule that
      refers to the UrlMap this HttpRouteRuleMatch belongs to. metadataFilters
      only applies to load balancers that have loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. Not supported when the URL map is bound to a
      target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
    pathTemplateMatch: If specified, the route is a pattern match expression
      that must match the :path header once the query string is removed. A
      pattern match allows you to match - The value must be between 1 and 1024
      characters - The pattern must start with a leading slash ("/") - There
      may be no more than 5 operators in pattern Precisely one of
      prefix_match, full_path_match, regex_match or path_template_match must
      be set.
    prefixMatch: For satisfying the matchRule condition, the request's path
      must begin with the specified prefixMatch. prefixMatch must begin with a
      /. The value must be from 1 to 1024 characters. Only one of prefixMatch,
      fullPathMatch or regexMatch must be specified.
    queryParameterMatches: Specifies a list of query parameter match criteria,
      all of which must match corresponding query parameters in the request.
      Not supported when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy.
    regexMatch: For satisfying the matchRule condition, the path of the

  r"""Represents a InstantSnapshot resource. You can use instant snapshots to
  create disk rollback points quickly..

  Enums:
    ArchitectureValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The architecture of the instant
      snapshot. Valid values are ARM64 or X86_64.
    StatusValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The status of the instantSnapshot.
      This can be CREATING, DELETING, FAILED, or READY.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Labels to apply to this InstantSnapshot. These can be later
      modified by the setLabels method. Label values may be empty.

  Fields:
    architecture: [Output Only] The architecture of the instant snapshot.
      Valid values are ARM64 or X86_64.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    diskSizeGb: [Output Only] Size of the source disk, specified in GB.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#instantSnapshot
      for InstantSnapshot resources.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      InstantSnapshot, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve a InstantSnapshot.
    labels: Labels to apply to this InstantSnapshot. These can be later
      modified by the setLabels method. Label values may be empty.
    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the instant snapshot
      resides. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It
      is not settable as a field in the request body.
    resourceStatus: [Output Only] Status information for the instant snapshot
      resource.
    satisfiesPzi: Output only. Reserved for future use.
    satisfiesPzs: [Output Only] Reserved for future use.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    selfLinkWithId: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource's
      resource id.
    sourceDisk: URL of the source disk used to create this instant snapshot.
      Note that the source disk must be in the same zone/region as the instant
      snapshot to be created. This can be a full or valid partial URL. For
      example, the following are valid values: -
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone
      /disks/disk -
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/regions/region

      projects/project/regions/region/disks/disk - zones/zone/disks/disk -
      regions/region/disks/disk
    sourceDiskId: [Output Only] The ID value of the disk used to create this
      InstantSnapshot. This value may be used to determine whether the
      InstantSnapshot was taken from the current or a previous instance of a
      given disk name.
    status: [Output Only] The status of the instantSnapshot. This can be
      CREATING, DELETING, FAILED, or READY.

      configure a pair of attachments, one per availability domain. The
      selected availability domain will be provided to the Partner via the
      pairing key, so that the provisioned circuit will lie in the specified
      domain. If not specified, the value will default to
      AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_ANY.
    encryption: Indicates the user-supplied encryption option of this VLAN
      attachment (interconnectAttachment). Can only be specified at attachment
      creation for PARTNER or DEDICATED attachments. Possible values are: -
      NONE - This is the default value, which means that the VLAN attachment
      carries unencrypted traffic. VMs are able to send traffic to, or receive
      traffic from, such a VLAN attachment. - IPSEC - The VLAN attachment
      carries only encrypted traffic that is encrypted by an IPsec device,
      such as an HA VPN gateway or third-party IPsec VPN. VMs cannot directly
      send traffic to, or receive traffic from, such a VLAN attachment. To use
      *HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect*, the VLAN attachment must be created
      with this option.
    googleReferenceId: [Output Only] Google reference ID, to be used when
      raising support tickets with Google or otherwise to debug backend
      connectivity issues. [Deprecated] This field is not used.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    interconnect: URL of the underlying Interconnect object that this
      attachment's traffic will traverse through.

      reserved for the VLAN attachment. Used only for the VLAN attachment that
      has the encryption option as IPSEC. The addresses must be regional
      internal IP address ranges. When creating an HA VPN gateway over the
      VLAN attachment, if the attachment is configured to use a regional
      internal IP address, then the VPN gateway's IP address is allocated from
      the IP address range specified here. For example, if the HA VPN
      gateway's interface 0 is paired to this VLAN attachment, then a regional
      internal IP address for the VPN gateway interface 0 will be allocated
      from the IP address specified for this VLAN attachment. If this field is
      not specified when creating the VLAN attachment, then later on when
      creating an HA VPN gateway on this VLAN attachment, the HA VPN gateway's
      IP address is allocated from the regional external IP address pool.

      Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update
      labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order
      to update or change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error
      412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request
      to retrieve an InterconnectAttachment.
    labels: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by

      InterconnectAttachment. This property is populated if the interconnect
      that this is attached to is of type DEDICATED.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional interconnect
      attachment resides. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP
      request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body.
    remoteService: [Output Only] If the attachment is on a Cross-Cloud
      Interconnect connection, this field contains the interconnect's remote
      location service provider. Example values: "Amazon Web Services"
      "Microsoft Azure". The field is set only for attachments on Cross-Cloud
      Interconnect connections. Its value is copied from the
      InterconnectRemoteLocation remoteService field.
    router: URL of the Cloud Router to be used for dynamic routing. This

      creation and update interconnect attachment operations.
    state: [Output Only] The current state of this attachment's functionality.
      Enum values ACTIVE and UNPROVISIONED are shared by DEDICATED/PRIVATE,
      PARTNER, and PARTNER_PROVIDER interconnect attachments, while enum
      values PENDING_PARTNER, PARTNER_REQUEST_RECEIVED, and PENDING_CUSTOMER
      are used for only PARTNER and PARTNER_PROVIDER interconnect attachments.
      This state can take one of the following values: - ACTIVE: The
      attachment has been turned up and is ready to use. - UNPROVISIONED: The
      attachment is not ready to use yet, because turnup is not complete. -
      PENDING_PARTNER: A newly-created PARTNER attachment that has not yet
      been configured on the Partner side. - PARTNER_REQUEST_RECEIVED: A
      PARTNER attachment is in the process of provisioning after a
      PARTNER_PROVIDER attachment was created that references it. -
      PENDING_CUSTOMER: A PARTNER or PARTNER_PROVIDER attachment that is
      waiting for a customer to activate it. - DEFUNCT: The attachment was
      deleted externally and is no longer functional. This could be because
      the associated Interconnect was removed, or because the other side of a
      Partner attachment was deleted.
    subnetLength: Length of the IPv4 subnet mask. Allowed values: - 29
      (default) - 30 The default value is 29, except for Cross-Cloud
      Interconnect connections that use an InterconnectRemoteLocation with a
      constraints.subnetLengthRange.min equal to 30. For example, connections
      that use an Azure remote location fall into this category. In these
      cases, the default value is 30, and requesting 29 returns an error.
      Where both 29 and 30 are allowed, 29 is preferred, because it gives
      Google Cloud Support more debugging visibility.
    type: The type of interconnect attachment this is, which can take one of
      the following values: - DEDICATED: an attachment to a Dedicated
      Interconnect. - PARTNER: an attachment to a Partner Interconnect,
      created by the customer. - PARTNER_PROVIDER: an attachment to a Partner
      Interconnect, created by the partner.

      addresses, use IPV4_IPV6. If not specified, IPV4_ONLY is used. This
      field can be both set at instance creation and update network interface
      operations.

  Fields:
    accessConfigs: An array of configurations for this interface. Currently,
      only one access config, ONE_TO_ONE_NAT, is supported. If there are no
      accessConfigs specified, then this instance will have no external
      internet access.
    aliasIpRanges: An array of alias IP ranges for this network interface. You

    internalIpv6PrefixLength: The prefix length of the primary internal IPv6
      range.
    ipv6AccessConfigs: An array of IPv6 access configurations for this
      interface. Currently, only one IPv6 access config, DIRECT_IPV6, is
      supported. If there is no ipv6AccessConfig specified, then this instance
      will have no external IPv6 Internet access.
    ipv6AccessType: [Output Only] One of EXTERNAL, INTERNAL to indicate

      inherited from its subnetwork. Valid only if stackType is IPV4_IPV6.
    ipv6Address: An IPv6 internal network address for this network interface.
      To use a static internal IP address, it must be unused and in the same
      region as the instance's zone. If not specified, Google Cloud will
      automatically assign an internal IPv6 address from the instance's
      subnetwork.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#networkInterface
      for network interfaces.
    name: [Output Only] The name of the network interface, which is generated
      by the server. For a VM, the network interface uses the nicN naming
      format. Where N is a value between 0 and 7. The default interface value
      is nic0.
    network: URL of the VPC network resource for this instance. When creating
      an instance, if neither the network nor the subnetwork is specified, the
      default network global/networks/default is used. If the selected project
      doesn't have the default network, you must specify a network or subnet.
      If the network is not specified but the subnetwork is specified, the
      network is inferred. If you specify this property, you can specify the
      network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all
      valid URLs: -
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/networks/
      network - projects/project/global/networks/network -
      global/networks/default
    networkAttachment: The URL of the network attachment that this interface
      should connect to in the following format: projects/{project_number}/reg
      ions/{region_name}/networkAttachments/{network_attachment_name}.
    networkIP: An IPv4 internal IP address to assign to the instance for this
      network interface. If not specified by the user, an unused internal IP
      is assigned by the system.
    nicType: The type of vNIC to be used on this interface. This may be gVNIC
      or VirtioNet.
    queueCount: The networking queue count that's specified by users for the
      network interface. Both Rx and Tx queues will be set to this number.
      It'll be empty if not specified by the users.
    stackType: The stack type for this network interface. To assign only IPv4
      addresses, use IPV4_ONLY. To assign both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, use
      IPV4_IPV6. If not specified, IPV4_ONLY is used. This field can be both
      set at instance creation and update network interface operations.
    subnetwork: The URL of the Subnetwork resource for this instance. If the
      network resource is in legacy mode, do not specify this field. If the
      network is in auto subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is optional.
      If the network is in custom subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is
      required. If you specify this field, you can specify the subnetwork as a
      full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs: -

  r"""Settings controlling the eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load
  balancing pool for the backend service.

  Fields:
    baseEjectionTime: The base time that a backend endpoint is ejected for.
      Defaults to 30000ms or 30s. After a backend endpoint is returned back to
      the load balancing pool, it can be ejected again in another ejection
      analysis. Thus, the total ejection time is equal to the base ejection
      time multiplied by the number of times the backend endpoint has been
      ejected. Defaults to 30000ms or 30s.
    consecutiveErrors: Number of consecutive errors before a backend endpoint
      is ejected from the load balancing pool. When the backend endpoint is
      accessed over HTTP, a 5xx return code qualifies as an error. Defaults to
      5.
    consecutiveGatewayFailure: The number of consecutive gateway failures
      (502, 503, 504 status or connection errors that are mapped to one of
      those status codes) before a consecutive gateway failure ejection
      occurs. Defaults to 3.
    enforcingConsecutiveErrors: The percentage chance that a backend endpoint
      will be ejected when an outlier status is detected through consecutive
      5xx. This setting can be used to disable ejection or to ramp it up
      slowly. Defaults to 0.
    enforcingConsecutiveGatewayFailure: The percentage chance that a backend
      endpoint will be ejected when an outlier status is detected through
      consecutive gateway failures. This setting can be used to disable
      ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
    enforcingSuccessRate: The percentage chance that a backend endpoint will
      be ejected when an outlier status is detected through success rate
      statistics. This setting can be used to disable ejection or to ramp it
      up slowly. Defaults to 100. Not supported when the backend service uses
      Serverless NEG.
    interval: Time interval between ejection analysis sweeps. This can result
      in both new ejections and backend endpoints being returned to service.
      The interval is equal to the number of seconds as defined in
      outlierDetection.interval.seconds plus the number of nanoseconds as
      defined in outlierDetection.interval.nanos. Defaults to 1 second.
    maxEjectionPercent: Maximum percentage of backend endpoints in the load
      balancing pool for the backend service that can be ejected if the
      ejection conditions are met. Defaults to 50%.
    successRateMinimumHosts: The number of backend endpoints in the load
      balancing pool that must have enough request volume to detect success
      rate outliers. If the number of backend endpoints is fewer than this
      setting, outlier detection via success rate statistics is not performed
      for any backend endpoint in the load balancing pool. Defaults to 5. Not
      supported when the backend service uses Serverless NEG.
    successRateRequestVolume: The minimum number of total requests that must
      be collected in one interval (as defined by the interval duration above)
      to include this backend endpoint in success rate based outlier
      detection. If the volume is lower than this setting, outlier detection
      via success rate statistics is not performed for that backend endpoint.
      Defaults to 100. Not supported when the backend service uses Serverless
      NEG.
    successRateStdevFactor: This factor is used to determine the ejection
      threshold for success rate outlier ejection. The ejection threshold is
      the difference between the mean success rate, and the product of this
      factor and the standard deviation of the mean success rate: mean -
      (stdev * successRateStdevFactor). This factor is divided by a thousand
      to get a double. That is, if the desired factor is 1.9, the runtime
      value should be 1900. Defaults to 1900. Not supported when the backend
      service uses Serverless NEG.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    rules: This is deprecated and has no effect. Do not use.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).

    match: A match condition that incoming traffic is evaluated against. If it
      evaluates to true, the corresponding 'action' is enforced.
    networkMatch: A match condition that incoming packets are evaluated
      against for CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK security policies. If it matches, the
      corresponding 'action' is enforced. The match criteria for a rule
      consists of built-in match fields (like 'srcIpRanges') and potentially
      multiple user-defined match fields ('userDefinedFields'). Field values
      may be extracted directly from the packet or derived from it (e.g.
      'srcRegionCodes'). Some fields may not be present in every packet (e.g.
      'srcPorts'). A user-defined field is only present if the base header is
      found in the packet and the entire field is in bounds. Each match field
      may specify which values can match it, listing one or more ranges,
      prefixes, or exact values that are considered a match for the field. A
      field value must be present in order to match a specified match field.
      If no match values are specified for a match field, then any field value
      is considered to match it, and it's not required to be present. For
      strings specifying '*' is also equivalent to match all. For a packet to
      match a rule, all specified match fields must match the corresponding
      field values derived from the packet. Example: networkMatch:
      srcIpRanges: - "192.0.2.0/24" - "198.51.100.0/24" userDefinedFields: -
      name: "ipv4_fragment_offset" values: - "1-0x1fff" The above match
      condition matches packets with a source IP in 192.0.2.0/24 or
      198.51.100.0/24 and a user-defined field named "ipv4_fragment_offset"
      with a value between 1 and 0x1fff inclusive.
    preconfiguredWafConfig: Preconfigured WAF configuration to be applied for
      the rule. If the rule does not evaluate preconfigured WAF rules, i.e.,

      effect.
    preview: If set to true, the specified action is not enforced.
    priority: An integer indicating the priority of a rule in the list. The
      priority must be a positive value between 0 and 2147483647. Rules are
      evaluated from highest to lowest priority where 0 is the highest
      priority and 2147483647 is the lowest priority.

      property when you create the resource.
    diskSizeGb: [Output Only] Size of the source disk, specified in GB.
    downloadBytes: [Output Only] Number of bytes downloaded to restore a
      snapshot to a disk.
    enableConfidentialCompute: Whether this snapshot is created from a
      confidential compute mode disk. [Output Only]: This field is not set by
      user, but from source disk.
    guestOsFeatures: [Output Only] A list of features to enable on the guest
      operating system. Applicable only for bootable images. Read Enabling
      guest operating system features to see a list of available options.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#snapshot for
      Snapshot resources.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      snapshot, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve a snapshot.
    labels: Labels to apply to this snapshot. These can be later modified by
      the setLabels method. Label values may be empty.
    licenseCodes: [Output Only] Integer license codes indicating which
      licenses are attached to this snapshot.
    licenses: [Output Only] A list of public visible licenses that apply to
      this snapshot. This can be because the original image had licenses
      attached (such as a Windows image).
    locationHint: An opaque location hint used to place the snapshot close to
      other resources. This field is for use by internal tools that use the
      public API.
    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    satisfiesPzi: Output only. Reserved for future use.
    satisfiesPzs: [Output Only] Reserved for future use.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    snapshotEncryptionKey: Encrypts the snapshot using a customer-supplied
      encryption key. After you encrypt a snapshot using a customer-supplied
      key, you must provide the same key if you use the snapshot later. For
      example, you must provide the encryption key when you create a disk from
      the encrypted snapshot in a future request. Customer-supplied encryption
      keys do not protect access to metadata of the snapshot. If you do not
      provide an encryption key when creating the snapshot, then the snapshot
      will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and you do not
      need to provide a key to use the snapshot later.
    snapshotType: Indicates the type of the snapshot.
    sourceDisk: The source disk used to create this snapshot.
    sourceDiskEncryptionKey: The customer-supplied encryption key of the
      source disk. Required if the source disk is protected by a customer-
      supplied encryption key.
    sourceDiskForRecoveryCheckpoint: The source disk whose recovery checkpoint
      will be used to create this snapshot.
    sourceDiskId: [Output Only] The ID value of the disk used to create this
      snapshot. This value may be used to determine whether the snapshot was
      taken from the current or a previous instance of a given disk name.
    sourceInstantSnapshot: The source instant snapshot used to create this
      snapshot. You can provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource.
      For example, the following are valid values: -
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone
      /instantSnapshots/instantSnapshot -
      projects/project/zones/zone/instantSnapshots/instantSnapshot -
      zones/zone/instantSnapshots/instantSnapshot
    sourceInstantSnapshotEncryptionKey: Customer provided encryption key when
      creating Snapshot from Instant Snapshot.
    sourceInstantSnapshotId: [Output Only] The unique ID of the instant
      snapshot used to create this snapshot. This value identifies the exact
      instant snapshot that was used to create this persistent disk. For
      example, if you created the persistent disk from an instant snapshot
      that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
      instant snapshot ID would identify the exact instant snapshot that was
      used.
    sourceSnapshotSchedulePolicy: [Output Only] URL of the resource policy
      which created this scheduled snapshot.
    sourceSnapshotSchedulePolicyId: [Output Only] ID of the resource policy
      which created this scheduled snapshot.
    status: [Output Only] The status of the snapshot. This can be CREATING,
      DELETING, FAILED, READY, or UPLOADING.
    storageBytes: [Output Only] A size of the storage used by the snapshot. As
      snapshots share storage, this number is expected to change with snapshot
      creation/deletion.
    storageBytesStatus: [Output Only] An indicator whether storageBytes is in
      a stable state or it is being adjusted as a result of shared storage
      reallocation. This status can either be UPDATING, meaning the size of
      the snapshot is being updated, or UP_TO_DATE, meaning the size of the
      snapshot is up-to-date.
    storageLocations: Cloud Storage bucket storage location of the snapshot
      (regional or multi-regional).

  SSL certificates (sslCertificates) are used by: - Global external
  Application Load Balancers - Classic Application Load Balancers - Proxy
  Network Load Balancers (with target SSL proxies) The regional SSL
  certificates (regionSslCertificates) are used by: - Regional external
  Application Load Balancers - Regional internal Application Load Balancers
  Optionally, certificate file contents that you upload can contain a set of
  up to five PEM-encoded certificates. The API call creates an object
  (sslCertificate) that holds this data. You can use SSL keys and certificates
  to secure connections to a load balancer. For more information, read
  Creating and using SSL certificates, SSL certificates quotas and limits, and
  Troubleshooting SSL certificates.

      first time the subnet is updated into IPV4_IPV6 dual stack.
    PrivateIpv6GoogleAccessValueValuesEnum: This field is for internal use.
      This field can be both set at resource creation time and updated using
      patch.
    PurposeValueValuesEnum: The purpose of the resource. This field can be
      either PRIVATE, GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY, REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY,
      PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT, or PRIVATE is the default purpose for user-
      created subnets or subnets that are automatically created in auto mode
      networks. Subnets with purpose set to GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY or
      REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY are user-created subnetworks that are reserved
      for Envoy-based load balancers. A subnet with purpose set to
      PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT is used to publish services using Private
      Service Connect. If unspecified, the subnet purpose defaults to PRIVATE.
      The enableFlowLogs field isn't supported if the subnet purpose field is
      set to GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY or REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY.
    RoleValueValuesEnum: The role of subnetwork. Currently, this field is only
      used when purpose is set to GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY or
      REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY. The value can be set to ACTIVE or BACKUP. An
      ACTIVE subnetwork is one that is currently being used for Envoy-based
      load balancers in a region. A BACKUP subnetwork is one that is ready to
      be promoted to ACTIVE or is currently draining. This field can be
      updated with a patch request.
    StackTypeValueValuesEnum: The stack type for the subnet. If set to
      IPV4_ONLY, new VMs in the subnet are assigned IPv4 addresses only. If
      set to IPV4_IPV6, new VMs in the subnet can be assigned both IPv4 and
      IPv6 addresses. If not specified, IPV4_ONLY is used. This field can be
      both set at resource creation time and updated using patch.
    StateValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The state of the subnetwork, which can
      be one of the following values: READY: Subnetwork is created and ready
      to use DRAINING: only applicable to subnetworks that have the purpose
      set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER and indicates that connections to
      the load balancer are being drained. A subnetwork that is draining
      cannot be used or modified until it reaches a status of READY

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource. This field can be set only at
      resource creation time.
    enableFlowLogs: Whether to enable flow logging for this subnetwork. If
      this field is not explicitly set, it will not appear in get listings. If
      not set the default behavior is determined by the org policy, if there
      is no org policy specified, then it will default to disabled. This field
      isn't supported if the subnet purpose field is set to
      REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY.
    externalIpv6Prefix: The external IPv6 address range that is owned by this
      subnetwork.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a Subnetwork. An up-to-date fingerprint
      must be provided in order to update the Subnetwork, otherwise the
      request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest
      fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a Subnetwork.
    gatewayAddress: [Output Only] The gateway address for default routes to
      reach destination addresses outside this subnetwork.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    internalIpv6Prefix: [Output Only] The internal IPv6 address range that is
      assigned to this subnetwork.
    ipCidrRange: The range of internal addresses that are owned by this
      subnetwork. Provide this property when you create the subnetwork. For
      example, 10.0.0.0/8 or 100.64.0.0/10. Ranges must be unique and non-
      overlapping within a network. Only IPv4 is supported. This field is set
      at resource creation time. The range can be any range listed in the
      Valid ranges list. The range can be expanded after creation using
      expandIpCidrRange.
    ipv6AccessType: The access type of IPv6 address this subnet holds. It's
      immutable and can only be specified during creation or the first time
      the subnet is updated into IPV4_IPV6 dual stack.
    ipv6CidrRange: [Output Only] This field is for internal use.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#subnetwork for
      Subnetwork resources.
    logConfig: This field denotes the VPC flow logging options for this
      subnetwork. If logging is enabled, logs are exported to Cloud Logging.
    name: The name of the resource, provided by the client when initially
      creating the resource. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply
      with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and
      match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means
      the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
    network: The URL of the network to which this subnetwork belongs, provided
      by the client when initially creating the subnetwork. This field can be
      set only at resource creation time.
    privateIpGoogleAccess: Whether the VMs in this subnet can access Google
      services without assigned external IP addresses. This field can be both
      set at resource creation time and updated using
      setPrivateIpGoogleAccess.
    privateIpv6GoogleAccess: This field is for internal use. This field can be
      both set at resource creation time and updated using patch.
    purpose: The purpose of the resource. This field can be either PRIVATE,
      GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY, REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY, PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT,
      or PRIVATE is the default purpose for user-created subnets or subnets
      that are automatically created in auto mode networks. Subnets with
      purpose set to GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY or REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY are user-
      created subnetworks that are reserved for Envoy-based load balancers. A
      subnet with purpose set to PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT is used to publish
      services using Private Service Connect. If unspecified, the subnet
      purpose defaults to PRIVATE. The enableFlowLogs field isn't supported if
      the subnet purpose field is set to GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY or
      REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY.
    region: URL of the region where the Subnetwork resides. This field can be
      set only at resource creation time.
    reservedInternalRange: The URL of the reserved internal range.
    role: The role of subnetwork. Currently, this field is only used when
      purpose is set to GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY or REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY. The
      value can be set to ACTIVE or BACKUP. An ACTIVE subnetwork is one that
      is currently being used for Envoy-based load balancers in a region. A
      BACKUP subnetwork is one that is ready to be promoted to ACTIVE or is
      currently draining. This field can be updated with a patch request.
    secondaryIpRanges: An array of configurations for secondary IP ranges for
      VM instances contained in this subnetwork. The primary IP of such VM
      must belong to the primary ipCidrRange of the subnetwork. The alias IPs
      may belong to either primary or secondary ranges. This field can be
      updated with a patch request.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    stackType: The stack type for the subnet. If set to IPV4_ONLY, new VMs in
      the subnet are assigned IPv4 addresses only. If set to IPV4_IPV6, new
      VMs in the subnet can be assigned both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If not
      specified, IPV4_ONLY is used. This field can be both set at resource
      creation time and updated using patch.
    state: [Output Only] The state of the subnetwork, which can be one of the
      following values: READY: Subnetwork is created and ready to use
      DRAINING: only applicable to subnetworks that have the purpose set to
      INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER and indicates that connections to the load

  [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionTargetHttpProxies) A target
  HTTP proxy is a component of Google Cloud HTTP load balancers. *
  targetHttpProxies are used by global external Application Load Balancers,
  classic Application Load Balancers, cross-region internal Application Load
  Balancers, and Traffic Director. * regionTargetHttpProxies are used by
  regional internal Application Load Balancers and regional external
  Application Load Balancers. Forwarding rules reference a target HTTP proxy,
  and the target proxy then references a URL map. For more information, read
  Using Target Proxies and Forwarding rule concepts.

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a TargetHttpProxy. An up-to-date
      fingerprint must be provided in order to patch/update the
      TargetHttpProxy; otherwise, the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve the TargetHttpProxy.
    httpKeepAliveTimeoutSec: Specifies how long to keep a connection open,
      after completing a response, while there is no matching traffic (in
      seconds). If an HTTP keep-alive is not specified, a default value (610
      seconds) will be used. For global external Application Load Balancers,
      the minimum allowed value is 5 seconds and the maximum allowed value is
      1200 seconds. For classic Application Load Balancers, this option is not
      supported.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#targetHttpProxy for
      target HTTP proxies.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    proxyBind: This field only applies when the forwarding rule that
      references this target proxy has a loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. When this field is set to true, Envoy proxies set
      up inbound traffic interception and bind to the IP address and port
      specified in the forwarding rule. This is generally useful when using
      Traffic Director to configure Envoy as a gateway or middle proxy (in
      other words, not a sidecar proxy). The Envoy proxy listens for inbound
      requests and handles requests when it receives them. The default is
      false.

  classic Application Load Balancers, cross-region internal Application Load
  Balancers, and Traffic Director. * regionTargetHttpProxies are used by
  regional internal Application Load Balancers and regional external

      is not specified, NONE is implied.

  Fields:
    authorizationPolicy: Optional. A URL referring to a
      networksecurity.AuthorizationPolicy resource that describes how the
      proxy should authorize inbound traffic. If left blank, access will not
      be restricted by an authorization policy. Refer to the
      AuthorizationPolicy resource for additional details. authorizationPolicy
      only applies to a global TargetHttpsProxy attached to
      globalForwardingRules with the loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. Note: This field currently has no impact.
    certificateMap: URL of a certificate map that identifies a certificate map
      associated with the given target proxy. This field can only be set for
      global target proxies. If set, sslCertificates will be ignored. Accepted
      format is //certificatemanager.googleapis.com/projects/{project

    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a TargetHttpsProxy. An up-to-date
      fingerprint must be provided in order to patch the TargetHttpsProxy;
      otherwise, the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see
      the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve the
      TargetHttpsProxy.
    httpKeepAliveTimeoutSec: Specifies how long to keep a connection open,
      after completing a response, while there is no matching traffic (in
      seconds). If an HTTP keep-alive is not specified, a default value (610
      seconds) will be used. For global external Application Load Balancers,
      the minimum allowed value is 5 seconds and the maximum allowed value is
      1200 seconds. For classic Application Load Balancers, this option is not
      supported.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#targetHttpsProxy for
      target HTTPS proxies.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    proxyBind: This field only applies when the forwarding rule that
      references this target proxy has a loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. When this field is set to true, Envoy proxies set
      up inbound traffic interception and bind to the IP address and port
      specified in the forwarding rule. This is generally useful when using
      Traffic Director to configure Envoy as a gateway or middle proxy (in
      other words, not a sidecar proxy). The Envoy proxy listens for inbound
      requests and handles requests when it receives them. The default is
      false.
    quicOverride: Specifies the QUIC override policy for this TargetHttpsProxy
      resource. This setting determines whether the load balancer attempts to
      negotiate QUIC with clients. You can specify NONE, ENABLE, or DISABLE. -
      When quic-override is set to NONE, Google manages whether QUIC is used.
      - When quic-override is set to ENABLE, the load balancer uses QUIC when
      possible. - When quic-override is set to DISABLE, the load balancer
      doesn't use QUIC. - If the quic-override flag is not specified, NONE is
      implied.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional
      TargetHttpsProxy resides. This field is not applicable to global
      TargetHttpsProxies.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    serverTlsPolicy: Optional. A URL referring to a
      networksecurity.ServerTlsPolicy resource that describes how the proxy
      should authenticate inbound traffic. serverTlsPolicy only applies to a
      global TargetHttpsProxy attached to globalForwardingRules with the
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or EXTERNAL or
      EXTERNAL_MANAGED. For details which ServerTlsPolicy resources are
      accepted with INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED and which with EXTERNAL,
      EXTERNAL_MANAGED loadBalancingScheme consult ServerTlsPolicy
      documentation. If left blank, communications are not encrypted.
    sslCertificates: URLs to SslCertificate resources that are used to
      authenticate connections between users and the load balancer. At least
      one SSL certificate must be specified. Currently, you may specify up to
      15 SSL certificates. sslCertificates do not apply when the load
      balancing scheme is set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    sslPolicy: URL of SslPolicy resource that will be associated with the
      TargetHttpsProxy resource. If not set, the TargetHttpsProxy resource has
      no SSL policy configured.
    urlMap: A fully-qualified or valid partial URL to the UrlMap resource that
      defines the mapping from URL to the BackendService. For example, the
      following are all valid URLs for specifying a URL map: -

  Enums:
    SessionAffinityValueValuesEnum: Session affinity option, must be one of

      to any instance in the pool. CLIENT_IP: Connections from the same client
      IP will go to the same instance in the pool while that instance remains
      healthy. CLIENT_IP_PROTO: Connections from the same client IP with the
      same IP protocol will go to the same instance in the pool while that
      instance remains healthy.

  Fields:
    backupPool: The server-defined URL for the resource. This field is
      applicable only when the containing target pool is serving a forwarding
      rule as the primary pool, and its failoverRatio field is properly set to
      a value between [0, 1]. backupPool and failoverRatio together define the

      pool. In case where failoverRatio and backupPool are not set, or all the
      instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed
      back to the primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic will be
      spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all
      instances when no instance is healthy.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    failoverRatio: This field is applicable only when the containing target
      pool is serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool (i.e., not as a
      backup pool to some other target pool). The value of the field must be
      in [0, 1]. If set, backupPool must also be set. They together define the
      fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the
      healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below this number,
      traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup
      pool. In case where failoverRatio is not set or all the instances in the
      backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the
      primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the
      healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no
      instance is healthy.
    healthChecks: The URL of the HttpHealthCheck resource. A member instance
      in this pool is considered healthy if and only if the health checks
      pass. Only legacy HttpHealthChecks are supported. Only one health check
      may be specified.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    instances: A list of resource URLs to the virtual machine instances
      serving this pool. They must live in zones contained in the same region

    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#targetPool for
      target pools.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first

      cannot be a dash.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the target pool resides.
    securityPolicy: [Output Only] The resource URL for the security policy
      associated with this target pool.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    sessionAffinity: Session affinity option, must be one of the following

    LabelsValue: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified
      by the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    forwardingRules: [Output Only] A list of URLs to the ForwardingRule
      resources. ForwardingRules are created using
      compute.forwardingRules.insert and associated with a VPN gateway.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#targetVpnGateway for
      target VPN gateways.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      TargetVpnGateway, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve a TargetVpnGateway.
    labels: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by
      the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    network: URL of the network to which this VPN gateway is attached.
      Provided by the client when the VPN gateway is created.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the target VPN gateway
      resides. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It
      is not settable as a field in the request body.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    status: [Output Only] The status of the VPN gateway, which can be one of
      the following: CREATING, READY, FAILED, or DELETING.
    tunnels: [Output Only] A list of URLs to VpnTunnel resources. VpnTunnels
      are created using the compute.vpntunnels.insert method and associated
      with a VPN gateway.

  is a component of certain types of cloud load balancers and Traffic
  Director: * urlMaps are used by global external Application Load Balancers,
  classic Application Load Balancers, and cross-region internal Application
  Load Balancers. * regionUrlMaps are used by internal Application Load
  Balancers, regional external Application Load Balancers and regional
  internal Application Load Balancers. For a list of supported URL map
  features by the load balancer type, see the Load balancing features: Routing
  and traffic management table. For a list of supported URL map features for
  Traffic Director, see the Traffic Director features: Routing and traffic
  management table. This resource defines mappings from hostnames and URL
  paths to either a backend service or a backend bucket. To use the global
  urlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of
  either EXTERNAL or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. To use the regionUrlMaps resource,
  the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of INTERNAL_MANAGED. For
  more information, read URL Map Concepts.

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    defaultRouteAction: defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the
      hostRules match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions,
      such as URL rewrites and header transformations, before forwarding the
      request to the selected backend. If defaultRouteAction specifies any
      weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set. Conversely if
      defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Only one of defaultRouteAction or
      defaultUrlRedirect must be set. URL maps for classic Application Load
      Balancers only support the urlRewrite action within defaultRouteAction.
      defaultRouteAction has no effect when the URL map is bound to a target
      gRPC proxy that has the validateForProxyless field set to true.
    defaultService: The full or partial URL of the defaultService resource to
      which traffic is directed if none of the hostRules match. If
      defaultRouteAction is also specified, advanced routing actions, such as
      URL rewrites, take effect before sending the request to the backend.
      However, if defaultService is specified, defaultRouteAction cannot
      contain any weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if routeAction
      specifies any weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified.
      Only one of defaultService, defaultUrlRedirect , or
      defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be set. defaultService
      has no effect when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has
      the validateForProxyless field set to true.
    defaultUrlRedirect: When none of the specified hostRules match, the
      request is redirected to a URL specified by defaultUrlRedirect. If
      defaultUrlRedirect is specified, defaultService or defaultRouteAction
      must not be set. Not supported when the URL map is bound to a target
      gRPC proxy.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field is
      ignored when inserting a UrlMap. An up-to-date fingerprint must be
      provided in order to update the UrlMap, otherwise the request will fail
      with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a
      get() request to retrieve a UrlMap.
    headerAction: Specifies changes to request and response headers that need
      to take effect for the selected backendService. The headerAction
      specified here take effect after headerAction specified under
      pathMatcher. headerAction is not supported for load balancers that have
      their loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL. Not supported when the URL
      map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field
      set to true.
    hostRules: The list of host rules to use against the URL.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#urlMaps for url
      maps.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    pathMatchers: The list of named PathMatchers to use against the URL.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional URL map
      resides. This field is not applicable to global URL maps. You must

      as a field in the request body.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    tests: The list of expected URL mapping tests. Request to update the
      UrlMap succeeds only if all test cases pass. You can specify a maximum

      containing the scheme, host, path and query parameters. For rules that
      forward requests to backends, the test passes only when
      expectedOutputUrl matches the request forwarded by the load balancer to
      backends. For rules with urlRewrite, the test verifies that the
      forwarded request matches hostRewrite and pathPrefixRewrite in the
      urlRewrite action. When service is specified, expectedOutputUrl`s scheme
      is ignored. For rules with urlRedirect, the test passes only if
      expectedOutputUrl matches the URL in the load balancer's redirect
      response. If urlRedirect specifies https_redirect, the test passes only
      if the scheme in expectedOutputUrl is also set to HTTPS. If urlRedirect
      specifies strip_query, the test passes only if expectedOutputUrl does
      not contain any query parameters. expectedOutputUrl is optional when
      service is specified.
    expectedRedirectResponseCode: For rules with urlRedirect, the test passes
      only if expectedRedirectResponseCode matches the HTTP status code in
      load balancer's redirect response. expectedRedirectResponseCode cannot
      be set when service is set.
    headers: HTTP headers for this request. If headers contains a host header,
      then host must also match the header value.
    host: Host portion of the URL. If headers contains a host header, then

    path: Path portion of the URL.
    service: Expected BackendService or BackendBucket resource the given URL
      should be mapped to. The service field cannot be set if
