      is an optional Cloud Storage namespace path (this is not a Cloud
      Datastore namespace), and `OVERALL_EXPORT_METADATA_FILE` is the metadata
      file written by the ExportEntities operation. For more information about
      Cloud Storage namespace paths, see [Object name
      considerations](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming#object-

    ResponseValue: The normal, successful response of the operation. If the
      original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the
      response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard
      `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other

    done: If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in

    name: The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same
      service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping,
