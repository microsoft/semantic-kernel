  Messages:
    EnvironmentValue: The environment to pass into the container. This
      environment is merged with values specified in the
      google.genomics.v2alpha1.Pipeline message, overwriting any duplicate
      values. In addition to the values passed here, a few other values are
      automatically injected into the environment. These cannot be hidden or
      overwritten. `GOOGLE_PIPELINE_FAILED` will be set to "1" if the pipeline
      failed because an action has exited with a non-zero status (and did not
      have the `IGNORE_EXIT_STATUS` flag set). This can be used to determine
      if additional debug or logging actions should execute.
      `GOOGLE_LAST_EXIT_STATUS` will be set to the exit status of the last
      non-background action that executed. This can be used by workflow engine
      authors to determine whether an individual action has succeeded or
      failed.
    LabelsValue: Labels to associate with the action. This field is provided
      to assist workflow engine authors in identifying actions (for example,
      to indicate what sort of action they perform, such as localization or
      debugging). They are returned in the operation metadata, but are
      otherwise ignored.
    PortMappingsValue: A map of containers to host port mappings for this
      container. If the container already specifies exposed ports, use the
      `PUBLISH_EXPOSED_PORTS` flag instead. The host port number must be less
      than 65536. If it is zero, an unused random port is assigned. To
      determine the resulting port number, consult the `ContainerStartedEvent`
      in the operation metadata.

  Fields:
    commands: If specified, overrides the `CMD` specified in the container. If
      the container also has an `ENTRYPOINT` the values are used as entrypoint
      arguments. Otherwise, they are used as a command and arguments to run
      inside the container.
    credentials: If the specified image is hosted on a private registry other
      than Google Container Registry, the credentials required to pull the
      image must be specified here as an encrypted secret. The secret must
      decrypt to a JSON-encoded dictionary containing both `username` and
      `password` keys.
    encryptedEnvironment: The encrypted environment to pass into the
      container. This environment is merged with values specified in the
      google.genomics.v2alpha1.Pipeline message, overwriting any duplicate
      values. The secret must decrypt to a JSON-encoded dictionary where key-
      value pairs serve as environment variable names and their values. The
      decoded environment variables can overwrite the values specified by the
      `environment` field.
    entrypoint: If specified, overrides the `ENTRYPOINT` specified in the
      container.
    environment: The environment to pass into the container. This environment
      is merged with values specified in the google.genomics.v2alpha1.Pipeline
      message, overwriting any duplicate values. In addition to the values
      passed here, a few other values are automatically injected into the
      environment. These cannot be hidden or overwritten.
      `GOOGLE_PIPELINE_FAILED` will be set to "1" if the pipeline failed
      because an action has exited with a non-zero status (and did not have
      the `IGNORE_EXIT_STATUS` flag set). This can be used to determine if
      additional debug or logging actions should execute.
      `GOOGLE_LAST_EXIT_STATUS` will be set to the exit status of the last
      non-background action that executed. This can be used by workflow engine
      authors to determine whether an individual action has succeeded or
      failed.
    flags: The set of flags to apply to this action.
    imageUri: Required. The URI to pull the container image from. Note that
      all images referenced by actions in the pipeline are pulled before the
      first action runs. If multiple actions reference the same image, it is
      only pulled once, ensuring that the same image is used for all actions
      in a single pipeline. The image URI can be either a complete host and
      image specification (e.g., quay.io/biocontainers/samtools), a library
      and image name (e.g., google/cloud-sdk) or a bare image name ('bash') to
      pull from the default library. No schema is required in any of these
      cases. If the specified image is not public, the service account
      specified for the Virtual Machine must have access to pull the images
      from GCR, or appropriate credentials must be specified in the
      google.genomics.v2alpha1.Action.credentials field.
    labels: Labels to associate with the action. This field is provided to
      assist workflow engine authors in identifying actions (for example, to
      indicate what sort of action they perform, such as localization or
      debugging). They are returned in the operation metadata, but are
      otherwise ignored.
    mounts: A list of mounts to make available to the action. In addition to
      the values specified here, every action has a special virtual disk
      mounted under `/google` that contains log files and other operational
      components. - /google/logs All logs written during the pipeline
      execution. - /google/logs/output The combined standard output and
      standard error of all actions run as part of the pipeline execution. -
      /google/logs/action/*/stdout The complete contents of each individual
      action's standard output. - /google/logs/action/*/stderr The complete
      contents of each individual action's standard error output.
    name: An optional name for the container. The container hostname will be
      set to this name, making it useful for inter-container communication.
      The name must contain only upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters
      and hyphens and cannot start with a hyphen.
    pidNamespace: An optional identifier for a PID namespace to run the action
      inside. Multiple actions should use the same string to share a
      namespace. If unspecified, a separate isolated namespace is used.
    portMappings: A map of containers to host port mappings for this
      container. If the container already specifies exposed ports, use the
      `PUBLISH_EXPOSED_PORTS` flag instead. The host port number must be less
      than 65536. If it is zero, an unused random port is assigned. To
      determine the resulting port number, consult the `ContainerStartedEvent`
      in the operation metadata.
    timeout: The maximum amount of time to give the action to complete. If the
      action fails to complete before the timeout, it will be terminated and
      the exit status will be non-zero. The pipeline will continue or
      terminate based on the rules defined by the `ALWAYS_RUN` and
      `IGNORE_EXIT_STATUS` flags.
  """

  class FlagsValueListEntryValuesEnum(_messages.Enum):
    r"""FlagsValueListEntryValuesEnum enum type.

    Values:
      FLAG_UNSPECIFIED: Unspecified flag.
      IGNORE_EXIT_STATUS: Normally, a non-zero exit status causes the pipeline
        to fail. This flag allows execution of other actions to continue
        instead.
      RUN_IN_BACKGROUND: This flag allows an action to continue running in the
        background while executing subsequent actions. This is useful to
        provide services to other actions (or to provide debugging support
        tools like SSH servers).
      ALWAYS_RUN: By default, after an action fails, no further actions are
        run. This flag indicates that this action must be run even if the
        pipeline has already failed. This is useful for actions that copy
        output files off of the VM or for debugging. Note that no actions will
        be run if image prefetching fails.
      ENABLE_FUSE: Enable access to the FUSE device for this action.
        Filesystems can then be mounted into disks shared with other actions.
        The other actions do not need the `ENABLE_FUSE` flag to access the
        mounted filesystem. This has the effect of causing the container to be
        executed with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and exposes `/dev/fuse` to the
        container, so use it only for containers you trust.
      PUBLISH_EXPOSED_PORTS: Exposes all ports specified by `EXPOSE`
        statements in the container. To discover the host side port numbers,
        consult the `ACTION_STARTED` event in the operation metadata.
      DISABLE_IMAGE_PREFETCH: All container images are typically downloaded
        before any actions are executed. This helps prevent typos in URIs or
        issues like lack of disk space from wasting large amounts of compute
        resources. If set, this flag prevents the worker from downloading the
        image until just before the action is executed.
      DISABLE_STANDARD_ERROR_CAPTURE: A small portion of the container's
        standard error stream is typically captured and returned inside the
        `ContainerStoppedEvent`. Setting this flag disables this
        functionality.
      BLOCK_EXTERNAL_NETWORK: Prevents the container from accessing the
        external network.

      ALREADY_EXISTS: The entity that a client attempted to create (e.g., file
        or directory) already exists. HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
      PERMISSION_DENIED: The caller does not have permission to execute the
        specified operation. `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used for
        rejections caused by exhausting some resource (use
        `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` instead for those errors). `PERMISSION_DENIED`
        must not be used if the caller can not be identified (use
        `UNAUTHENTICATED` instead for those errors). This error code does not
        imply the request is valid or the requested entity exists or satisfies
        other pre-conditions. HTTP Mapping: 403 Forbidden
      UNAUTHENTICATED: The request does not have valid authentication
        credentials for the operation. HTTP Mapping: 401 Unauthorized
      RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user
        quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space. HTTP
        Mapping: 429 Too Many Requests
      FAILED_PRECONDITION: The operation was rejected because the system is
        not in a state required for the operation's execution. For example,
        the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is
        applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the
        following guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
        `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can
        retry just the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should
        retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-
        and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-
        write sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not
        retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For example,
        if an "rmdir" fails because the directory is non-empty,
        `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should not
        retry unless the files are deleted from the directory. HTTP Mapping:
        400 Bad Request
      ABORTED: The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue
        such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort. See the
        guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
        `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`. HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
      OUT_OF_RANGE: The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g.,
        seeking or reading past end-of-file. Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this
        error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state
        changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will generate
        `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to read at an offset that is not in the
        range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read
        from an offset past the current file size. There is a fair bit of
        overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`. We recommend
        using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific error) when it applies so that
        callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an
        `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they are done. HTTP Mapping: 400
        Bad Request
      UNIMPLEMENTED: The operation is not implemented or is not
        supported/enabled in this service. HTTP Mapping: 501 Not Implemented
      INTERNAL: Internal errors. This means that some invariants expected by
        the underlying system have been broken. This error code is reserved
        for serious errors. HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
      UNAVAILABLE: The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a
        transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with a
        backoff. Note that it is not always safe to retry non-idempotent
        operations. See the guidelines above for deciding between
        `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`. HTTP Mapping: 503

      default value is used.
    bootImage: The host operating system image to use. Currently, only
      Container-Optimized OS images can be used. The default value is
      `projects/cos-cloud/global/images/family/cos-stable`, which selects the
      latest stable release of Container-Optimized OS. This option is provided

    dockerCacheImages: The Compute Engine Disk Images to use as a Docker
      cache. The disks will be mounted into the Docker folder in a way that
      the images present in the cache will not need to be pulled. The digests
      of the cached images must match those of the tags used or the latest

      Must be the short name of a standard machine type (such as
      "n1-standard-1") or a custom machine type (such as "custom-1-4096",
      where "1" indicates the number of vCPUs and "4096" indicates the memory

    reservation: If specified, the VM will only be allocated inside the
      matching reservation. It will fail if the VM parameters don't match the
      reservation.
