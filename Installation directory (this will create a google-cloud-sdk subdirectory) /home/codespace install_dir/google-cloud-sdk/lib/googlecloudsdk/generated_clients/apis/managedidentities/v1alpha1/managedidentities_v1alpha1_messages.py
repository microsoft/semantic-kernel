      not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding
      might grant the same role to one or more of the principals in this
      binding. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
      policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
    members: Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud
      resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A
      special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with
      or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special
      identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google
      account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from
      external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. *
      `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google
      account. For example, `alice@example.com` . *
      `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google
      service account. For example, `my-other-
      app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. *
      `serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]`:
      An identifier for a [Kubernetes service
      account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-
      to/kubernetes-service-accounts). For example, `my-
      project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]`. *
      `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For
      example, `admins@example.com`. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain
      (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example,

      (e.g. if it's being created or ready to use).

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Optional. Resource labels to represent user provided
      metadata. Each label is a key-value pair, where both the key and the
      value are arbitrary strings provided by the user.

      primarily to expose producer-specific information in monitoring
      dashboards. See go/get-instance-metadata.
    SoftwareVersionsValue: Software versions that are used to deploy this
      instance. This can be mutated by rollout services.

  Fields:
    consumerDefinedName: consumer_defined_name is the name of the instance set
      by the service consumers. Generally this is different from the `name`
      field which reperesents the system-assigned id of the instance which the
      service consumers do not recognize. This is a required field for tenants
      onboarding to Maintenance Window notifications (go/slm-rollout-
      maintenance-policies#prerequisites).
    createTime: Output only. Timestamp when the resource was created.
    instanceType: Optional. The instance_type of this instance of format: proj
      ects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/instanceTypes/{instance_ty
      pe_id}. Instance Type represents a high-level tier or SKU of the service
      that this instance belong to. When enabled(eg: Maintenance Rollout),
      Rollout uses 'instance_type' along with 'software_versions' to determine
      whether instance needs an update or not.
    labels: Optional. Resource labels to represent user provided metadata.
      Each label is a key-value pair, where both the key and the value are
      arbitrary strings provided by the user.
    maintenancePolicyNames: Optional. The MaintenancePolicies that have been
      attached to the instance. The key must be of the type name of the oneof
      policy name defined in MaintenancePolicy, and the referenced policy must
      define the same policy type. For details, please refer to go/mr-user-
      guide. Should not be set if maintenance_settings.maintenance_policies is
      set.
    maintenanceSchedules: The MaintenanceSchedule contains the scheduling
      information of published maintenance schedule with same key as
      software_versions.
    maintenanceSettings: Optional. The MaintenanceSettings associated with
      instance.
    name: Unique name of the resource. It uses the form: `projects/{project_nu
      mber}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}` Note: This name
      is passed, stored and logged across the rollout system. So use of
      consumer project_id or any other consumer PII in the name is strongly
      discouraged for wipeout (go/wipeout) compliance. See
      go/elysium/project_ids#storage-guidance for more details.
    notificationParameters: Optional. notification_parameter are information
      that service producers may like to include that is not relevant to
      Rollout. This parameter will only be passed to Gamma and Cloud Logging
      for notification/logging purpose.
    producerMetadata: Output only. Custom string attributes used primarily to
      expose producer-specific information in monitoring dashboards. See
      go/get-instance-metadata.
    provisionedResources: Output only. The list of data plane resources
      provisioned for this instance, e.g. compute VMs. See go/get-instance-
      metadata.
    slmInstanceTemplate: Link to the SLM instance template. Only populated
      when updating SLM instances via SSA's Actuation service adaptor. Service
      producers with custom control plane (e.g. Cloud SQL) doesn't need to
      populate this field. Instead they should use software_versions.
    sloMetadata: Output only. SLO metadata for instance classification in the
      Standardized dataplane SLO platform. See go/cloud-ssa-standard-slo for
      feature description.
    softwareVersions: Software versions that are used to deploy this instance.
      This can be mutated by rollout services.
    state: Output only. Current lifecycle state of the resource (e.g. if it's
      being created or ready to use).
    tenantProjectId: Output only. ID of the associated GCP tenant project. See

  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
