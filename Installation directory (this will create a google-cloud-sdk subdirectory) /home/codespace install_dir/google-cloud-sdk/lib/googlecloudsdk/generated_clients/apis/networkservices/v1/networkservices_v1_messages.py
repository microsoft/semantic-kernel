class CDNPolicy(_messages.Message):
  r"""The CDN policy to apply to the configured route.

  Enums:
    CacheModeValueValuesEnum: Optional. Set the CacheMode used by this route.
      BYPASS_CACHE and USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS proxy the origin's headers. Other
      cache modes pass Cache-Control to the client. Use client_ttl to override
      what is sent to the client.
    SignedRequestModeValueValuesEnum: Optional. Specifies whether to enforce
      signed requests. The default value is DISABLED, which means all content
      is public, and does not authorize access. You must also set a
      signed_request_keyset to enable signed requests. When set to
      REQUIRE_SIGNATURES or REQUIRE_TOKENS, all matching requests get their
      signature validated. Requests that aren't signed with the corresponding
      private key, or that are otherwise invalid (such as expired or do not
      match the signature, IP address, or header) are rejected with an HTTP
      403 error. If logging is turned on, then invalid requests are also
      logged.

  Messages:
    NegativeCachingPolicyValue: Optional. A cache TTL for the specified HTTP
      status code. negative_caching must be enabled to configure
      `negative_caching_policy`. The following limitations apply: - Omitting
      the policy and leaving `negative_caching` enabled uses the default TTLs
      for each status code, defined in `negative_caching`. - TTLs must be >=
      `0` (where `0` is "always revalidate") and <= `86400s` (1 day) You can
      set only the following status codes: - HTTP redirection (`300`, `301`,
      `302`, `307`, or `308`) - Client error (`400`, `403`, `404`, `405`,
      `410`, `421`, or `451`) - Server error (`500`, `501`, `502`, `503`, or
      `504`) When you specify an explicit `negative_caching_policy`, ensure
      that you also specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish
      to cache. The CDNPolicy doesn't apply any default negative caching when
      a policy exists.

  Fields:
    addSignatures: Optional. Enables signature generation or propagation on
      this route. This field can only be specified when signed_request_mode is
      set to REQUIRE_TOKENS.
    cacheKeyPolicy: Optional. The request parameters that contribute to the
      cache key.
    cacheMode: Optional. Set the CacheMode used by this route. BYPASS_CACHE
      and USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS proxy the origin's headers. Other cache modes
      pass Cache-Control to the client. Use client_ttl to override what is
      sent to the client.
    clientTtl: Optional. Specifies a separate client (such as browser client)
      TTL, separate from the TTL used by the edge caches. Leaving this empty
      uses the same cache TTL for both the CDN and the client-facing response.
      - The TTL must be > `0` and <= `86400s` (1 day) - The `client_ttl`
      cannot be larger than the default_ttl (if set) - Fractions of a second
      are not allowed. Omit this field to use the `default_ttl`, or the max-
      age set by the origin, as the client-facing TTL. When the CacheMode is
      set to USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS or BYPASS_CACHE, you must omit this field.
    defaultTtl: Optional. Specifies the default TTL for cached content served
      by this origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL
      (max-age or s-max-age). Defaults to `3600s` (1 hour). - The TTL must be
      >= `0` and <= `31,536,000` seconds (1 year) - Setting a TTL of `0` means
      "always revalidate" (equivalent to must-revalidate) - The value of
      `default_ttl` cannot be set to a value greater than that of max_ttl. -
      Fractions of a second are not allowed. - When the CacheMode is set to
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the `default_ttl` overwrites the TTL set in all
      responses. Infrequently accessed objects might be evicted from the cache
      before the defined TTL. Objects that expire are revalidated with the
      origin. When the CacheMode is set to USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS or BYPASS_CACHE,
      you must omit this field.
    maxTtl: Optional. The maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by
      this origin. Defaults to `86400s` (1 day). Cache directives that attempt
      to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires header more
      than `max_ttl` seconds in the future are capped at the value of
      `max_ttl`, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control
      directive. - The TTL must be >= `0` and <= `31,536,000` seconds (1 year)
      - Setting a TTL of `0` means "always revalidate" - The value of
      `max_ttl` must be equal to or greater than default_ttl. - Fractions of a
      second are not allowed. When CacheMode is set to
      [USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS].[CacheMode.USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS], FORCE_CACHE_ALL, or
      BYPASS_CACHE, you must omit this field.
    negativeCaching: Optional. Negative caching allows setting per-status code
      TTLs, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or
      redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user
      experience by reducing response latency. By default, the CDNPolicy
      applies the following default TTLs to these status codes: - **10m**:
      HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects) - **120s**:
      HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons) -
      **60s**: HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 501 (Not Implemented) These
      defaults can be overridden in negative_caching_policy
    negativeCachingPolicy: Optional. A cache TTL for the specified HTTP status
      code. negative_caching must be enabled to configure
      `negative_caching_policy`. The following limitations apply: - Omitting
      the policy and leaving `negative_caching` enabled uses the default TTLs
      for each status code, defined in `negative_caching`. - TTLs must be >=
      `0` (where `0` is "always revalidate") and <= `86400s` (1 day) You can
      set only the following status codes: - HTTP redirection (`300`, `301`,
      `302`, `307`, or `308`) - Client error (`400`, `403`, `404`, `405`,
      `410`, `421`, or `451`) - Server error (`500`, `501`, `502`, `503`, or
      `504`) When you specify an explicit `negative_caching_policy`, ensure
      that you also specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish
      to cache. The CDNPolicy doesn't apply any default negative caching when
      a policy exists.
    signedRequestKeyset: Optional. The EdgeCacheKeyset containing the set of
      public keys used to validate signed requests at the edge. The following
      are both valid paths to an `EdgeCacheKeyset` resource: *
      `projects/project/locations/global/edgeCacheKeysets/yourKeyset` *
      `yourKeyset` SignedRequestMode must be set to a value other than
      DISABLED when a keyset is provided.
    signedRequestMaximumExpirationTtl: Optional. Limits how far into the
      future the expiration time of a signed request can be. When set, a
      signed request is rejected if its expiration time is later than `now` +
      `signed_request_maximum_expiration_ttl`, where `now` is the time at
      which the signed request is first handled by the CDN. - The TTL must be
      > 0. - Fractions of a second are not allowed. By default,
      `signed_request_maximum_expiration_ttl` is not set and the expiration
      time of a signed request might be arbitrarily far into future.
    signedRequestMode: Optional. Specifies whether to enforce signed requests.
      The default value is DISABLED, which means all content is public, and
      does not authorize access. You must also set a signed_request_keyset to
      enable signed requests. When set to REQUIRE_SIGNATURES or
      REQUIRE_TOKENS, all matching requests get their signature validated.
      Requests that aren't signed with the corresponding private key, or that
      are otherwise invalid (such as expired or do not match the signature, IP
      address, or header) are rejected with an HTTP 403 error. If logging is
      turned on, then invalid requests are also logged.
    signedTokenOptions: Optional. Any additional options for signed tokens.
      `signed_token_options` can only be specified when `signed_request_mode`
      is `REQUIRE_TOKENS`.

    Values:
      CACHE_MODE_UNSPECIFIED: Unspecified value. Defaults to
        `CACHE_ALL_STATIC`.
      CACHE_ALL_STATIC: Automatically cache static content, including common
        image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and
        CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well
        as dynamic content (including HTML), aren't cached.
      USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS: Only cache responses with valid HTTP caching
        directives. Responses without these headers aren't cached at Google's
        edge, and require a full trip to the origin on every request,
        potentially impacting performance and increasing load on the origin
        server.
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL: Cache all content, ignoring any `private`, `no-store`
        or `no-cache` directives in Cache-Control response headers.

        identifiable) content. Only enable this on routes where the
        EdgeCacheOrigin doesn't serve private or dynamic content, such as
        storage buckets.
      BYPASS_CACHE: Bypass all caching for requests that match routes with

      security and performance. When using HTTP2 or HTTPS as the protocol, a
      valid, publicly-signed, unexpired TLS (SSL) certificate must be
      presented by the origin server.
    retryConditions: Optional. Specifies one or more retry conditions for the
      configured origin. If the failure mode during a connection attempt to
      the origin matches the configured `retryConditions` values, the origin
      request retries up to max_attempts times. The failover origin, if

  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -

  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call

      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
