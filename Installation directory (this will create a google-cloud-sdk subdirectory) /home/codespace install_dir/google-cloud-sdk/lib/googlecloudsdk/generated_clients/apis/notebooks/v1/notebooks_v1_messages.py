  r"""Associates `members`, or principals, with a `role`.

  Fields:
    condition: The condition that is associated with this binding. If the
      condition evaluates to `true`, then this binding applies to the current
      request. If the condition evaluates to `false`, then this binding does
      not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding
      might grant the same role to one or more of the principals in this
      binding. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
      policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
    members: Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud
      resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A
      special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with
      or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special
      identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google
      account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from
      external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. *
      `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google
      account. For example, `alice@example.com` . *
      `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google
      service account. For example, `my-other-
      app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. *
      `serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]`:
      An identifier for a [Kubernetes service
      account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-
      to/kubernetes-service-accounts). For example, `my-
      project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]`. *
      `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For
      example, `admins@example.com`. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain
      (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example,
      `google.com` or `example.com`. * `principal://iam.googleapis.com/locatio
      ns/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}`: A

    deviceName: Indicates a unique device name of your choice that is
      reflected into the `/dev/disk/by-id/google-*` tree of a Linux operating
      system running within the instance. This name can be used to reference
      the device for mounting, resizing, and so on, from within the instance.

      have a unique index number.
    interface: Indicates the disk interface to use for attaching this disk,

      create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method
      that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type,
      if any.
    ResponseValue: The normal, successful response of the operation. If the
      original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the
      response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard
      `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other
      methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is
      the original method name. For example, if the original method name is
      `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

  Fields:
    done: If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in
      progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or

    metadata: Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It

      create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method
      that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type,
      if any.
    name: The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same
      service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping,
      the `name` should be a resource name ending with
      `operations/{unique_id}`.
    response: The normal, successful response of the operation. If the
      original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the
      response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
