    Values:

      UNIMPLEMENTED: The feature is not yet implemented. Users can not use it.
      PRELAUNCH: Prelaunch features are hidden from users and are only visible
        internally.
      EARLY_ACCESS: Early Access features are limited to a closed group of
        testers. To use these features, you must sign up in advance and sign a
        Trusted Tester agreement (which includes confidentiality provisions).
        These features may be unstable, changed in backward-incompatible ways,
        and are not guaranteed to be released.
      ALPHA: Alpha is a limited availability test for releases before they are
        cleared for widespread use. By Alpha, all significant design issues
        are resolved and we are in the process of verifying functionality.
        Alpha customers need to apply for access, agree to applicable terms,
        and have their projects allowlisted. Alpha releases don't have to be
        feature complete, no SLAs are provided, and there are no technical
        support obligations, but they will be far enough along that customers
        can actually use them in test environments or for limited-use tests --
        just like they would in normal production cases.
      BETA: Beta is the point at which we are ready to open a release for any
        customer to use. There are no SLA or technical support obligations in
        a Beta release. Products will be complete from a feature perspective,
        but may have some open outstanding issues. Beta releases are suitable
        for limited production use cases.
      GA: GA features are open to all developers and are considered stable and
        fully qualified for production use.
      DEPRECATED: Deprecated features are scheduled to be shut down and
        removed. For more information, see the "Deprecation Policy" section of

      will be permamently deleted.
    generation: Output only. A number that monotonically increases every time
      the user modifies the desired state. Please note that unlike v1, this is
      an int64 value. As with most Google APIs, its JSON representation will
      be a `string` instead of an `integer`.
    ingress: Provides the ingress settings for this Service. On output,

    launchStage: The launch stage as defined by [Google Cloud Platform Launch
      Stages](https://cloud.google.com/terms/launch-stages). Cloud Run
      supports `ALPHA`, `BETA`, and `GA`. If no value is specified, GA is
      assumed. Set the launch stage to a preview stage on input to allow use

      representation will be a `string` instead of an `integer`.
    reconciling: Output only. Returns true if the Service is currently being
      acted upon by the system to bring it into the desired state. When a new
      Service is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run will
      asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the Service to the
      desired serving state. This process is called reconciliation. While
      reconciliation is in process, `observed_generation`,
      `latest_ready_revison`, `traffic_statuses`, and `uri` will have
      transient values that might mismatch the intended state: Once
      reconciliation is over (and this field is false), there are two possible
      outcomes: reconciliation succeeded and the serving state matches the
      Service, or there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state
      can be found in `terminal_condition.state`. If reconciliation succeeded,
      the following fields will match: `traffic` and `traffic_statuses`,
      `observed_generation` and `generation`, `latest_ready_revision` and
      `latest_created_revision`. If reconciliation failed, `traffic_statuses`,
      `observed_generation`, and `latest_ready_revision` will have the state
      of the last serving revision, or empty for newly created Services.
      Additional information on the failure can be found in
      `terminal_condition` and `conditions`.
    satisfiesPzs: Output only. Reserved for future use.
    scaling: Optional. Specifies service-level scaling settings
    template: Required. The template used to create revisions for this
      Service.
    terminalCondition: Output only. The Condition of this Service, containing
      its readiness status, and detailed error information in case it did not
      reach a serving state. See comments in `reconciling` for additional
      information on reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
    traffic: Specifies how to distribute traffic over a collection of
      Revisions belonging to the Service. If traffic is empty or not provided,
      defaults to 100% traffic to the latest `Ready` Revision.
    trafficStatuses: Output only. Detailed status information for
      corresponding traffic targets. See comments in `reconciling` for
      additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
    uid: Output only. Server assigned unique identifier for the trigger. The
      value is a UUID4 string and guaranteed to remain unchanged until the

      Otherwise, the build will succeed, but this step will still have a
      failure status. Error information will be reported in the failure_detail
      field.
    args: A list of arguments that will be presented to the step when it is
      started. If the image used to run the step's container has an
      entrypoint, the `args` are used as arguments to that entrypoint. If the
      image does not define an entrypoint, the first element in args is used
      as the entrypoint, and the remainder will be used as arguments.
    automapSubstitutions: Option to include built-in and custom substitutions
      as env variables for this build step. This option will override the
      global option in BuildOption.
    dir: Working directory to use when running this step's container. If this
      value is a relative path, it is relative to the build's working
      directory. If this value is absolute, it may be outside the build's
      working directory, in which case the contents of the path may not be

      step with a `dir`, which specifies an absolute path, the `RepoSource`
      `dir` is ignored for the step's execution.
    entrypoint: Entrypoint to be used instead of the build step image's
      default entrypoint. If unset, the image's default entrypoint is used.
    env: A list of environment variable definitions to be used when running a
      step. The elements are of the form "KEY=VALUE" for the environment
      variable "KEY" being given the value "VALUE".
    exitCode: Output only. Return code from running the step.
    id: Unique identifier for this build step, used in `wait_for` to reference
      this build step as a dependency.
    name: Required. The name of the container image that will run this
      particular build step. If the image is available in the host's Docker
      daemon's cache, it will be run directly. If not, the host will attempt
      to pull the image first, using the builder service account's credentials

      versions of all of the officially supported build steps
      ([https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-
      builders](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders)). The

      you attempt to use them. If you built an image in a previous build step,
      it will be stored in the host's Docker daemon's cache and is available
      to use as the name for a later build step.
    pullTiming: Output only. Stores timing information for pulling this build
      step's builder image only.
    script: A shell script to be executed in the step. When script is
      provided, the user cannot specify the entrypoint or args.
    secretEnv: A list of environment variables which are encrypted using a
      Cloud Key Management Service crypto key. These values must be specified
      in the build's `Secret`.
    status: Output only. Status of the build step. At this time, build step
      status is only updated on build completion; step status is not updated
      in real-time as the build progresses.
    timeout: Time limit for executing this build step. If not defined, the
      step has no time limit and will be allowed to continue to run until
      either it completes or the build itself times out.
    timing: Output only. Stores timing information for executing this build
      step.
    volumes: List of volumes to mount into the build step. Each volume is
      created as an empty volume prior to execution of the build step. Upon
      completion of the build, volumes and their contents are discarded. Using
      a named volume in only one step is not valid as it is indicative of a
      build request with an incorrect configuration.
    waitFor: The ID(s) of the step(s) that this build step depends on. This
      build step will not start until all the build steps in `wait_for` have
      completed successfully. If `wait_for` is empty, this build step will

class GoogleIamV1Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [

  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
