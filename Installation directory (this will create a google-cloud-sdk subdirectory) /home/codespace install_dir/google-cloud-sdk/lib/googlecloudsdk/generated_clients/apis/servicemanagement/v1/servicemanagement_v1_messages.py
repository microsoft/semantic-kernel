  r"""Api is a light-weight descriptor for an API Interface. Interfaces are
  also described as "protocol buffer services" in some contexts, such as by
  the "service" keyword in a .proto file, but they are different from API
  Services, which represent a concrete implementation of an interface as
  opposed to simply a description of methods and bindings. They are also
  sometimes simply referred to as "APIs" in other contexts, such as the name
  of this message itself. See https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/glossary
  for detailed terminology.

  Enums:
    SyntaxValueValuesEnum: The source syntax of the service.

  Fields:
    methods: The methods of this interface, in unspecified order.
    mixins: Included interfaces. See Mixin.
    name: The fully qualified name of this interface, including package name
      followed by the interface's simple name.
    options: Any metadata attached to the interface.
    sourceContext: Source context for the protocol buffer service represented
      by this message.
    syntax: The source syntax of the service.
    version: A version string for this interface. If specified, must have the
      form `major-version.minor-version`, as in `1.10`. If the minor version
      is omitted, it defaults to zero. If the entire version field is empty,
      the major version is derived from the package name, as outlined below.
      If the field is not empty, the version in the package name will be
      verified to be consistent with what is provided here. The versioning
      schema uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) where the major
      version number indicates a breaking change and the minor version an
      additive, non-breaking change. Both version numbers are signals to users
      what to expect from different versions, and should be carefully chosen
      based on the product plan. The major version is also reflected in the
      package name of the interface, which must end in `v`, as in
      `google.feature.v1`. For major versions 0 and 1, the suffix can be
      omitted. Zero major versions must only be used for experimental, non-GA
      interfaces.

  HTTP request body. It also controls how the gRPC response message is mapped
  to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is typically specified as an

  URL path template and an HTTP method. The path template may refer to one or

  repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type. The path template
  controls how fields of the request message are mapped to the URL path.
  Example: service Messaging { rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns
  (Message) { option (google.api.http) = { get: "/v1/{name=messages/*}" }; } }
  message GetMessageRequest { string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path. }
  message Message { string text = 1; // The resource content. } This enables
  an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `GET
  /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")` Any fields in
  the request message which are not bound by the path template automatically
  become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body. For example:
  service Messaging { rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
  option (google.api.http) = { get:"/v1/messages/{message_id}" }; } } message
  GetMessageRequest { message SubMessage { string subfield = 1; } string
  message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path. int64 revision = 2; // Mapped to URL
  query parameter `revision`. SubMessage sub = 3; // Mapped to URL query
  parameter `sub.subfield`. } This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as
  below: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `GET
  /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` | `GetMessage(message_id:
  "123456" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))` Note that fields
  which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a primitive type or a
  repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type. In the case of a
  repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL as
  `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the
  message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as
  `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`. For HTTP methods that allow a request body,
  the `body` field specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
  message resource collection: service Messaging { rpc
  UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) { option
  (google.api.http) = { patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}" body: "message" };
  } } message UpdateMessageRequest { string message_id = 1; // mapped to the
  URL Message message = 2; // mapped to the body } The following HTTP JSON to
  RPC mapping is enabled, where the representation of the JSON in the request
  body is determined by protos JSON encoding: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `PATCH
  /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456"
  message { text: "Hi!" })` The special name `*` can be used in the body
  mapping to define that every field not bound by the path template should be
  mapped to the request body. This enables the following alternative
  definition of the update method: service Messaging { rpc
  UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) { option (google.api.http) = {
  patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}" body: "*" }; } } message Message { string
  message_id = 1; string text = 2; } The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is
  enabled: HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!"
  }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" text: "Hi!")` Note that when using
  `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to have HTTP parameters, as all
  fields not bound by the path end in the body. This makes this option more
  rarely used in practice when defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is
  in custom methods which don't use the URL at all for transferring data. It
  is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using the
  `additional_bindings` option. Example: service Messaging { rpc
  GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) { option (google.api.http) =
  { get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}" additional_bindings { get:
  "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}" } }; } } message
  GetMessageRequest { string message_id = 1; string user_id = 2; } This
  enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings: HTTP | gRPC
  -----|----- `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`
  `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id:
  "123456")` ## Rules for HTTP mapping 1. Leaf request fields (recursive
  expansion nested messages in the request message) are classified into three
  categories: - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the
  URL path. - Fields referred by the HttpRule.body. They are passed via the
  HTTP request body. - All other fields are passed via the URL query
  parameters, and the parameter name is the field path in the request message.
  A repeated field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the
  same name. 2. If HttpRule.body is "*", there is no URL query parameter, all
  fields are passed via URL path and HTTP request body. 3. If HttpRule.body is
  omitted, there is no HTTP request body, all fields are passed via URL path
  and URL query parameters. ### Path template syntax Template = "/" Segments [
  Verb ] ; Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ; Segment = "*" | "**" | LITERAL
  | Variable ; Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ; FieldPath =
  IDENT { "." IDENT } ; Verb = ":" LITERAL ; The syntax `*` matches a single
  URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches zero or more URL path segments,
  which must be the last part of the URL path except the `Verb`. The syntax
  `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its template. A
  variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable matches a
  single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}` is equivalent
  to `{var=*}`. The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If
  the `LITERAL` contains any reserved character, such characters should be
  percent-encoded before the matching. If a variable contains exactly one path
  segment, such as `"{var}"` or `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is expanded
  into a URL path on the client side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]`
  are percent-encoded. The server side does the reverse decoding. Such
  variables show up in the [Discovery
  Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
  `{var}`. If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as
  `"{var=foo/*}"` or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL
  path on the client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are
  percent-encoded. The server side does the reverse decoding, except "%2F" and
  "%2f" are left unchanged. Such variables show up in the [Discovery
  Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
  `{+var}`. ## Using gRPC API Service Configuration gRPC API Service
  Configuration (service config) is a configuration language for configuring a
  gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The service config is simply
  the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service` proto message. As an
  alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC
  transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a
  `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same
  effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you have
  a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding
  specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding
  configuration in the proto. Example: http: rules: # Selects a gRPC method
  and applies HttpRule to it. - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage get:
  /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield} ## Special notes When gRPC
  Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the proto to JSON
  conversion must follow the [proto3
  specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-
  buffers/docs/proto3#json). While the single segment variable follows the
  semantics of [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2
  Simple String Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC
  6570 Section 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved
  Expansion does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would
  lead to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding
  for multi segment variables. The path variables **must not** refer to any
  repeated or mapped field, because client libraries are not capable of
  handling such variable expansion. The path variables **must not** capture
  the leading "/" character. The reason is that the most common use case
  "{var}" does not capture the leading "/" character. For consistency, all
  path variables must share the same behavior. Repeated message fields must
  not be mapped to URL query parameters, because no client library can support
  such complicated mapping. If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or
  response body, it can map the request or response body to a repeated field.
  However, some gRPC Transcoding implementations may not support this feature.

  Fields:
    additionalBindings: Additional HTTP bindings for the selector. Nested
      bindings must not contain an `additional_bindings` field themselves
      (that is, the nesting may only be one level deep).
    body: The name of the request field whose value is mapped to the HTTP
      request body, or `*` for mapping all request fields not captured by the
      path pattern to the HTTP body, or omitted for not having any HTTP
      request body. NOTE: the referred field must be present at the top-level
      of the request message type.
    custom: The custom pattern is used for specifying an HTTP method that is
      not included in the `pattern` field, such as HEAD, or "*" to leave the
      HTTP method unspecified for this rule. The wild-card rule is useful for
      services that provide content to Web (HTML) clients.
    delete: Maps to HTTP DELETE. Used for deleting a resource.
    get: Maps to HTTP GET. Used for listing and getting information about
      resources.
    patch: Maps to HTTP PATCH. Used for updating a resource.
    post: Maps to HTTP POST. Used for creating a resource or performing an
      action.
    put: Maps to HTTP PUT. Used for replacing a resource.
    responseBody: Optional. The name of the response field whose value is
      mapped to the HTTP response body. When omitted, the entire response
      message will be used as the HTTP response body. NOTE: The referred field
      must be present at the top-level of the response message type.
    selector: Selects a method to which this rule applies. Refer to selector
      for syntax details.

    metadata: Optional. Metadata which can be used to guide usage of the
      metric.
    metricKind: Whether the metric records instantaneous values, changes to a
      value, etc. Some combinations of `metric_kind` and `value_type` might
      not be supported.
    monitoredResourceTypes: Read-only. If present, then a time series, which
      is identified partially by a metric type and a
      MonitoredResourceDescriptor, that is associated with this metric type
      can only be associated with one of the monitored resource types listed
      here.
    name: The resource name of the metric descriptor.
    type: The metric type, including its DNS name prefix. The type is not URL-
      encoded. All user-defined metric types have the DNS name
      `custom.googleapis.com` or `external.googleapis.com`. Metric types
      should use a natural hierarchical grouping. For example:
      "custom.googleapis.com/invoice/paid/amount"
      "external.googleapis.com/prometheus/up"
      "appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies"
    unit: The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only
      applicable if the `value_type` is `INT64`, `DOUBLE`, or `DISTRIBUTION`.
      The `unit` defines the representation of the stored metric values.
      Different systems might scale the values to be more easily displayed (so
      a value of `0.02kBy` _might_ be displayed as `20By`, and a value of
      `3523kBy` _might_ be displayed as `3.5MBy`). However, if the `unit` is
      `kBy`, then the value of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no
      matter how it might be displayed. If you want a custom metric to record
      the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an `INT64
      CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit` is `s{CPU}` (or equivalently `1s{CPU}`
      or just `s`). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is
      written as `12005`. Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record
      data in a more granular way, you can create a `DOUBLE CUMULATIVE` metric
      whose `unit` is `ks{CPU}`, and then write the value `12.005` (which is
      `12005/1000`), or use `Kis{CPU}` and write `11.723` (which is
      `12005/1024`). The supported units are a subset of [The Unified Code for
      Units of Measure](https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:
      **Basic units (UNIT)** * `bit` bit * `By` byte * `s` second * `min`
      minute * `h` hour * `d` day * `1` dimensionless **Prefixes (PREFIX)** *
      `k` kilo (10^3) * `M` mega (10^6) * `G` giga (10^9) * `T` tera (10^12) *
      `P` peta (10^15) * `E` exa (10^18) * `Z` zetta (10^21) * `Y` yotta
      (10^24) * `m` milli (10^-3) * `u` micro (10^-6) * `n` nano (10^-9) * `p`
      pico (10^-12) * `f` femto (10^-15) * `a` atto (10^-18) * `z` zepto
      (10^-21) * `y` yocto (10^-24) * `Ki` kibi (2^10) * `Mi` mebi (2^20) *
      `Gi` gibi (2^30) * `Ti` tebi (2^40) * `Pi` pebi (2^50) **Grammar** The
      grammar also includes these connectors: * `/` division or ratio (as an
      infix operator). For examples, `kBy/{email}` or `MiBy/10ms` (although
      you should almost never have `/s` in a metric `unit`; rates should
      always be computed at query time from the underlying cumulative or delta
      value). * `.` multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For
      examples, `GBy.d` or `k{watt}.h`. The grammar for a unit is as follows:
      Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ; Component =
      ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation
      = "{" NAME "}" ; Notes: * `Annotation` is just a comment if it follows a
      `UNIT`. If the annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to
      `1`. For examples, `{request}/s == 1/s`, `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`. *
      `NAME` is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not
      containing `{` or `}`. * `1` represents a unitary [dimensionless
      unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such
      as in `1/s`. It is typically used when none of the basic units are
      appropriate. For example, "new users per day" can be represented as
      `1/d` or `{new-users}/d` (and a metric value `5` would mean "5 new
      users). Alternatively, "thousands of page views per day" would be
      represented as `1000/d` or `k1/d` or `k{page_views}/d` (and a metric
      value of `5.3` would mean "5300 page views per day"). * `%` represents
      dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving a percentage
      (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100, and a metric
      value `3` means "3 percent"). * `10^2.%` indicates a metric contains a
      ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and
      displayed as a percentage (so a metric value `0.03` means "3 percent").
    valueType: Whether the measurement is an integer, a floating-point number,
      etc. Some combinations of `metric_kind` and `value_type` might not be
      supported.

  google.storage.v2.Storage mixins: - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl The
  mixin construct implies that all methods in `AccessControl` are also

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",

  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-

  Messages:
    ValuesValue: Tiered limit values. You must specify this as a key:value
      pair, with an integer value that is the maximum number of requests
      allowed for the specified unit. Currently only STANDARD is supported.

  Fields:
    defaultLimit: Default number of tokens that can be consumed during the
      specified duration. This is the number of tokens assigned when a client
      application developer activates the service for his/her project.
      Specifying a value of 0 will block all requests. This can be used if you
      are provisioning quota to selected consumers and blocking others.
      Similarly, a value of -1 will indicate an unlimited quota. No other
      negative values are allowed. Used by group-based quotas only.
    description: Optional. User-visible, extended description for this quota
      limit. Should be used only when more context is needed to understand
      this limit than provided by the limit's display name (see:
      `display_name`).
    displayName: User-visible display name for this limit. Optional. If not
      set, the UI will provide a default display name based on the quota
      configuration. This field can be used to override the default display
      name generated from the configuration.
    duration: Duration of this limit in textual notation. Must be "100s" or
      "1d". Used by group-based quotas only.
    freeTier: Free tier value displayed in the Developers Console for this
      limit. The free tier is the number of tokens that will be subtracted
      from the billed amount when billing is enabled. This field can only be
      set on a limit with duration "1d", in a billable group; it is invalid on
      any other limit. If this field is not set, it defaults to 0, indicating
      that there is no free tier for this service. Used by group-based quotas
      only.
    maxLimit: Maximum number of tokens that can be consumed during the
      specified duration. Client application developers can override the
      default limit up to this maximum. If specified, this value cannot be set
      to a value less than the default limit. If not specified, it is set to
      the default limit. To allow clients to apply overrides with no upper
      bound, set this to -1, indicating unlimited maximum quota. Used by
      group-based quotas only.
    metric: The name of the metric this quota limit applies to. The quota
      limits with the same metric will be checked together during runtime. The
      metric must be defined within the service config.
    name: Name of the quota limit. The name must be provided, and it must be
      unique within the service. The name can only include alphanumeric
      characters as well as '-'. The maximum length of the limit name is 64
      characters.
    unit: Specify the unit of the quota limit. It uses the same syntax as
      Metric.unit. The supported unit kinds are determined by the quota
      backend system. Here are some examples: * "1/min/{project}" for quota
      per minute per project. Note: the order of unit components is
      insignificant. The "1" at the beginning is required to follow the metric
      unit syntax.

  r"""A ServicemanagementServicesRolloutsCreateRequest object.

  Fields:
    force: Optional. This flag will skip safety checks for this rollout. The

      Quota limit validation verifies that the default quota limits defined in
      the configs that are effective in this rollout don't decrease by more
      than a specific percentage (10% right now) from the configs that are
      effective in the current rollout. For group-based quota limits, the
      default limit for a quota limit cannot decrease by more than 10%. For
      metric-based quota limits, the assigned quota for each reputation tier
      cannot decrease by more than 10%. Regional quota is assigned per region,
      and the quota for each region cannot decrease by more than 10%. Removing
      a regional quota can cause an effective decrease for that region, if the
      global quota for that tier is lower. For example, if the current rollout
      has a quota limit with values: {STANDARD: 50, STANDARD/us-central1: 100}
      and it is to be changed in the new rollout to: {STANDARD: 50} The net
      effect is the STANDARD tier in us-central1 is decreased by 50%. Adding a
      regional quota can have a similar effect for that region. In order to
      gradually dial down default quota limit, the recommended practice is to
      create multiple rollouts at least 1 hour apart.
