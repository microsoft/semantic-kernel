    apiVersion: Output only. The API version that created this Node.
    cidrBlock: The CIDR block that the TPU node will use when selecting an IP
      address. This CIDR block must be a /29 block; the Compute Engine
      networks API forbids a smaller block, and using a larger block would be

      file for models to serve. The contents of the model_config.pbtxt is a

      this API has been activated. If none is provided, "default" will be

      be accessed and sent work. It is recommended that Tensorflow clients of
      the node reach out to the 0th entry in this map first.

    tensorflowVersion: Required. The version of Tensorflow running in the
      Node.
    useServiceNetworking: Whether the VPC peering for the node is set up
      through Service Networking API. The VPC Peering should be set up before
      provisioning the node. If this field is set, cidr_block field should not
