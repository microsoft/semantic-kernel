      more hosts are added/removed from the destination service. This field
      specifies parameters that control consistent hashing. This field is
      only applicable when localityLbPolicy is set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH.
      This field is applicable to either: - A regional backend service with

      Only send IPv4 traffic to the backends of the backend
      service (Instance Group, Managed Instance Group, Network
      Endpoint Group), regardless of traffic from the client to
      the proxy. Only IPv4 health checks are used to check the

      IPv6 health checks are used to check the health of the

      is selected in round robin order. This is the default.
      - LEAST_REQUEST: An O(1) algorithm which selects two
      random healthy hosts and picks the host which has
      fewer active requests. - RING_HASH: The ring/modulo
      hash load balancer implements consistent hashing to
      backends. The algorithm has the property that the
      addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only
      affects 1/N of the requests. - RANDOM: The load

      completely processed, including all retries. A stream
      that does not complete in this duration is closed. If
      not specified, there will be no timeout limit, i.e.
      the maximum duration is infinite. This value can be
      overridden in the PathMatcher configuration of the
      UrlMap that references this backend service. This
      field is only allowed when the loadBalancingScheme of
      the backend service is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

    description: |-
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the
      resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters
      long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name
      must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means
      the first character must be a lowercase letter, and

      letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.

  outlierDetection:
    description: |-
      Settings controlling the ejection of unhealthy backend
      endpoints from the load balancing pool of each
      individual proxy instance that processes the traffic
      for the given backend service. If not set, this
      feature is considered disabled. Results of the outlier
      detection algorithm (ejection of endpoints from the
      load balancing pool and returning them back to the
      pool) are executed independently by each proxy
      instance of the load balancer. In most cases, more
      than one proxy instance handles the traffic received
      by a backend service. Thus, it is possible that an
      unhealthy endpoint is detected and ejected by only
      some of the proxies, and while this happens, other
      proxies may continue to send requests to the same
      unhealthy endpoint until they detect and eject the
      unhealthy endpoint. Applicable backend endpoints can
      be: - VM instances in an Instance Group - Endpoints in
      a Zonal NEG (GCE_VM_IP, GCE_VM_IP_PORT) - Endpoints in
      a Hybrid Connectivity NEG (NON_GCP_PRIVATE_IP_PORT) -
      Serverless NEGs, that resolve to Cloud Run, App
      Engine, or Cloud Functions Services - Private Service
      Connect NEGs, that resolve to Google-managed regional
      API endpoints or managed services published using
      Private Service Connect Applicable backend service
      types can be: - A global backend service with the
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or
      EXTERNAL_MANAGED. - A regional backend service with
      the serviceProtocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED or
      EXTERNAL_MANAGED. Not supported for Serverless NEGs.
      Not supported when the backend service is referenced
      by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that
      has validateForProxyless field set to true.
