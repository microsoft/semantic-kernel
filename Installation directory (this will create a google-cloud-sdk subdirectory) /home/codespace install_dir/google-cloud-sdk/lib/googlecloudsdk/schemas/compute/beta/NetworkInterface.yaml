  accessConfigs:
    description: |-
      An array of configurations for this interface. Currently, only one access
      config, ONE_TO_ONE_NAT, is supported. If there are no accessConfigs
      specified, then this instance will have no external internet access.

  aliasIpRanges:
    description: |-
      An array of alias IP ranges for this network interface. You can only
      specify this field for network interfaces in VPC networks.

  fingerprint:
    description: |-
      Fingerprint hash of contents stored in this network interface.
      This field will be ignored when inserting an Instance or adding a
      NetworkInterface. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in
      order to update the NetworkInterface. The request will fail with
      error 400 Bad Request if the fingerprint is not provided, or 412
      Precondition Failed if the fingerprint is out of date.

  ipv6Address:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] An IPv6 internal network address for this network
      interface.
    type: string
  kind:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always
      compute#networkInterface for network interfaces.
    type: string
  name:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] The name of the network interface, which is
      generated by the server. For network devices, these are eth0,
      eth1, etc.
    type: string
  network:
    description: |-
      URL of the network resource for this instance. When creating an
      instance, if neither the network nor the subnetwork is specified,
      the default network global/networks/default is used; if the
      network is not specified but the subnetwork is specified, the
      network is inferred.  If you specify this property, you can
      specify the network as a full or partial URL. For example, the
      following are all valid URLs:   - https:// www.googleapis.com/comp
      ute/v1/projects/project/global/networks/network -
      projects/project/global/networks/network  -
      global/networks/default
    type: string
  networkIP:
    description: |-
      An IPv4 internal IP address to assign to the instance for this
      network interface. If not specified by the user, an unused
      internal IP is assigned by the system.
    type: string
  nicType:
    description: |-
      The type of vNIC to be used on this interface. This may be gVNIC
      or VirtioNet.
    type: string
    enum:
    - GVNIC
    - UNSPECIFIED_NIC_TYPE
    - VIRTIO_NET
  subnetwork:
    description: |-
      The URL of the Subnetwork resource for this instance. If the
      network resource is in legacy mode, do not specify this field. If
      the network is in auto subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is
      optional. If the network is in custom subnet mode, specifying the
      subnetwork is required. If you specify this field, you can specify
      the subnetwork as a full or partial URL. For example, the
      following are all valid URLs:   - https://www.googleapis.com/compu
      te/v1/projects/project/regions/region/su bnetworks/subnetwork  -
      regions/region/subnetworks/subnetwork
