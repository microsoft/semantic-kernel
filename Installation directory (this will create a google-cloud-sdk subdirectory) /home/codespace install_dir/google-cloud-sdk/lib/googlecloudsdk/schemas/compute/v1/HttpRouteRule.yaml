  description:
    description: |-
      The short description conveying the intent of this routeRule. The
      description can have a maximum length of 1024 characters.
    type: string
  headerAction:
    description: |-
      Specifies changes to request and response headers that need to take effect
      for the selected backendService. The headerAction value specified here is
      applied before the matching pathMatchers[].headerAction and after
      pathMatchers[].routeRules[].routeA
      ction.weightedBackendService.backendServiceWeightAction[].headerAction
      HeaderAction is not supported for load balancers that have their
      loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL. Not supported when the URL map is
      bound to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to
      true.
    $ref: HttpHeaderAction.yaml
  matchRules:
    description: |-
      The list of criteria for matching attributes of a request to this
      routeRule. This list has OR semantics: the request matches this routeRule
      when any of the matchRules are satisfied. However predicates within a
      given matchRule have AND semantics. All predicates within a matchRule must
      match for the request to match the rule.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: HttpRouteRuleMatch.yaml
  priority:
    description: |-
      For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the
      order in which a load balancer interprets routeRules. RouteRules are
      evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The
      priority of a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1).
      The first rule that matches the request is applied. You cannot
      configure two or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority for
      each rule must be set to a number from 0 to 2147483647 inclusive.
      Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove
      rules in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For
      example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority
      numbers to which you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11,
      and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact on existing rules.
    type: integer
  routeAction:
    description: |-
      In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer performs
      advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header
      transformations, before forwarding the request to the selected
      backend. If routeAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, service
      must not be set. Conversely if service is set, routeAction cannot
      contain any weightedBackendServices. Only one of urlRedirect, service
      or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set. URL maps for
      Classic external HTTP(S) load balancers only support the urlRewrite
      action within a route rule's routeAction.
    $ref: HttpRouteAction.yaml
  service:
    description: |-
      The full or partial URL of the backend service resource to which
      traffic is directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is also
      specified, advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites, take effect
      before sending the request to the backend. However, if service is
      specified, routeAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.
      Conversely, if routeAction specifies any weightedBackendServices,
      service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect, service or
      routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
    type: string
  urlRedirect:
    description: |-
      When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL
      specified by urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service or
      routeAction must not be set. Not supported when the URL map is bound
      to a target gRPC proxy.
