  defaultRouteAction:
    description: |-
      defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the pathRules or routeRules
      match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions, such as URL
      rewrites and header transformations, before forwarding the request to the
      selected backend. If defaultRouteAction specifies any
      weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set. Conversely if
      defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Only one of defaultRouteAction or
      defaultUrlRedirect must be set. URL maps for Classic external HTTP(S) load
      balancers only support the urlRewrite action within a path matcher's
      defaultRouteAction.
    $ref: HttpRouteAction.yaml
  defaultService:
    description: |-
      The full or partial URL to the BackendService resource. This URL is used
      if none of the pathRules or routeRules defined by this PathMatcher are
      matched. For example, the following are all valid URLs to a BackendService
      resource: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project
      /global/backendServices/backendService -
      compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendServices/backendService -
      global/backendServices/backendService If defaultRouteAction is also
      specified, advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites, take effect
      before sending the request to the backend. However, if defaultService is
      specified, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.
      Conversely, if defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices,
      defaultService must not be specified. Only one of defaultService,
      defaultUrlRedirect , or defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be
      set. Authorization requires one or more of the following Google IAM
      permissions on the specified resource default_service: -
      compute.backendBuckets.use - compute.backendServices.use
    type: string
  defaultUrlRedirect:
    description: |-
      When none of the specified pathRules or routeRules match, the request is
      redirected to a URL specified by defaultUrlRedirect. If defaultUrlRedirect
      is specified, defaultService or defaultRouteAction must not be set. Not
      supported when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy.

  description:
    description: |-
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you
      create the resource.
    type: string
  headerAction:
    description: |-
      Specifies changes to request and response headers that need to take effect
      for the selected backend service. HeaderAction specified here are applied
      after the matching HttpRouteRule HeaderAction and before the HeaderAction
      in the UrlMap HeaderAction is not supported for load balancers that have
      their loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL. Not supported when the URL map
      is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to
      true.

    type: string
  pathRules:
    description: |-
      The list of path rules. Use this list instead of routeRules when routing
      based on simple path matching is all that's required. The order by which
      path rules are specified does not matter. Matches are always done on the
      longest-path-first basis. For example: a pathRule with a path /a/b/c/*
      will match before /a/b/* irrespective of the order in which those paths
      appear in this list. Within a given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or
      routeRules must be set.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: PathRule.yaml
  routeRules:
    description: |-
      The list of HTTP route rules. Use this list instead of pathRules when
      advanced route matching and routing actions are desired. routeRules
      are evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number.
      Within a given pathMatcher, you can set only one of pathRules or
      routeRules.
