  caPool:
    description: |-
      A CA pool resource used to issue interception certificates. The CA pool
      string has a relative resource path following the form
      "projects/{project}/locations/{location}/caPools/{ca_pool}".
    type: string
  customTlsFeatures:
    description: |-
      List of custom TLS cipher suites selected. This field is valid only if the
      selected tls_feature_profile is CUSTOM. The
      compute.SslPoliciesService.ListAvailableFeatures method returns the set of
      features that can be specified in this list.

    type: string
  excludePublicCaSet:
    description: |-
      If FALSE (the default), use our default set of public CAs in addition
      to any CAs specified in trust_config. These public CAs are currently
      based on the Mozilla Root Program and are subject to change over time.
      If TRUE, do not accept our default set of public CAs. Only CAs
      specified in trust_config will be accepted. This defaults to FALSE
      (use public CAs in addition to trust_config) for backwards
      compatibility, but trusting public root CAs is *not recommended*
      unless the traffic in question is outbound to public web servers. When
      possible, prefer setting this to "false" and explicitly specifying
      trusted CAs and certificates in a TrustConfig. Note that Secure Web
      Proxy does not yet honor this field.
    type: boolean
  minTlsVersion:
    description: |-
      Minimum TLS version that the firewall should use when negotiating
      connections with both clients and servers. If this is not set, then
      the default value is to allow the broadest set of clients and servers
      (TLS 1.0 or higher). Setting this to more restrictive values may
      improve security, but may also prevent the firewall from connecting to
      some clients or servers. Note that Secure Web Proxy does not yet honor
      this field.
    type: string
    enum:
    - TLS_1_0
    - TLS_1_1
    - TLS_1_2
    - TLS_1_3
    - TLS_VERSION_UNSPECIFIED
  name:
    description: |-
      Name of the resource. Name is of the form projects/{projec
      t}/locations/{location}/tlsInspectionPolicies/{tls_inspection_policy}
      tls_inspection_policy should match the
      pattern:(^[a-z]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$).
    type: string
  tlsFeatureProfile:
    description: |-
      The selected Profile. If this is not set, then the default value is to
      allow the broadest set of clients and servers ("PROFILE_COMPATIBLE").
      Setting this to more restrictive values may improve security, but may
      also prevent the TLS inspection proxy from connecting to some clients
      or servers. Note that Secure Web Proxy does not yet honor this field.
    type: string
    enum:
    - PROFILE_COMPATIBLE
    - PROFILE_CUSTOM
    - PROFILE_MODERN
    - PROFILE_RESTRICTED
    - PROFILE_UNSPECIFIED
  trustConfig:
    description: |-
      A TrustConfig resource used when making a connection to the TLS
      server. This is a relative resource path following the form
      "projects/{project}/locations/{location}/trustConfigs/{trust_config}".
      This is necessary to intercept TLS connections to servers with
      certificates signed by a private CA or self-signed certificates. Note
      that Secure Web Proxy does not yet honor this field.
