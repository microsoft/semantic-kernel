  authorizationPolicy:
    description: |-
      This field specifies the URL of AuthorizationPolicy resource that applies
      authorization policies to the inbound traffic at the matched endpoints.
      Refer to Authorization. If this field is not specified, authorization is

      EndpointConfigSelectorType is SIDECAR_PROXY.
    type: string
  clientTlsPolicy:
    description: |-
      A URL referring to a ClientTlsPolicy resource. ClientTlsPolicy can be set
      to specify the authentication for traffic from the proxy to the actual
      endpoints. More specifically, it is applied to the outgoing traffic from
      the proxy to the endpoint. This is typically used for sidecar model where
      the proxy identifies itself as endpoint to the control plane, with the
      connection between sidecar and endpoint requiring authentication. If this
      field is not set, authentication is disabled(open). Applicable only when
      EndpointConfigSelectorType is SIDECAR_PROXY.
    type: string
  description:
    description: |-
      A free-text description of the resource. Max length 1024 characters.
    type: string

      authentication is disabled(open) for this endpoint.
