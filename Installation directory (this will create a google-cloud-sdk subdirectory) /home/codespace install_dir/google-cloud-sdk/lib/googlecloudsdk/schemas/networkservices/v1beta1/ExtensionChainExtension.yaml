  authority:
    description: |-
      The `:authority` header in the gRPC request sent from Envoy to the
      extension service. Required for Callout extensions.
    type: string
  failOpen:
    description: |-
      Determines how the proxy behaves if the call to the extension fails or
      times out. When set to `TRUE`, request or response processing continues
      without error. Any subsequent extensions in the extension chain are also
      executed. When set to `FALSE` or the default setting of `FALSE` is used,
      one of the following happens: * If response headers have not been
      delivered to the downstream client, a generic 500 error is returned to the
      client. The error response can be tailored by configuring a custom error
      response in the load balancer. * If response headers have been delivered,
      then the HTTP stream to the downstream client is reset.
    type: boolean
  forwardAttributes:
    description: |-
      List of the Envoy attributes to forward to the extension server. The
      attributes provided here will be included as part of the
      `ProcessingRequest.attributes` field (of type `map`), where the keys are
      the attribute names. Refer to the [documentation](/service-
      extensions/docs/cel-matcher-language-reference#attributes) for the names
      of attributes that can be forwarded. If omitted, no attributes will be
      sent. Each element is a string indicating the attribute name.

      type: string
  forwardHeaders:
    description: |-
      List of the HTTP headers to forward to the extension (from the client
      or backend). If omitted, all headers are sent. Each element is a
      string indicating the header name.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  name:
    description: |-
      The name for this extension. The name is logged as part of the
      HTTP request logs. The name must conform with RFC-1034, is
      restricted to lower-cased letters, numbers and hyphens, and can
      have a maximum length of 63 characters. Additionally, the first
      character must be a letter and the last a letter or a number.
    type: string
  service:
    description: |-
      The reference to the service that runs the extension. Currently
      only callout extensions are supported here. To configure a callout
      extension, `service` must be a fully-qualified reference to a
      [backend
      service](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v
      1/backendServices) in the format:
      `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1 /projects/{project}/regions
      /{region}/backendServices/{backendService}` or `https://www.google
      apis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/back
      endServices/{backendService}`.
    type: string
  supportedEvents:
    description: |-
      A set of events during request or response processing for which
      this extension is called. This field is required for the
      `LbTrafficExtension` resource. It's not relevant for the
      `LbRouteExtension` resource.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      enum:
      - EVENT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED
      - REQUEST_BODY
      - REQUEST_HEADERS
      - REQUEST_TRAILERS
      - RESPONSE_BODY
      - RESPONSE_HEADERS
      - RESPONSE_TRAILERS
  timeout:
    description: |-
      Specifies the timeout for each individual message on the
      stream. The timeout must be between 10-1000 milliseconds.
      Required for Callout extensions.
