      *{command}* sets the IAM policy for a Cloud Billing account given an
      account ID and a JSON or YAML file that describes the IAM policy.

      that account.

      The following command reads an IAM policy defined in the JSON file
      `policy.json` and sets it for a Billing account ID *123456-789876-543210*:

        $ {command} 123456-789876-543210 policy.json
