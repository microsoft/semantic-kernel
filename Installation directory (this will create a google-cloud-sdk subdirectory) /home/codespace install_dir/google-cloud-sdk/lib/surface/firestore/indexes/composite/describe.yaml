    # This format string gets the field config table (fieldPath,order,arrayConfig) to show up as
    # additional columns in the same row, as opposed to indented on the next line. Note that the
    # double quotes are needed as opposed to a multi-line YAML string, since the latter escapes
    # newline characters which we need to provide to .join() in order to get each field onto its
    # own line.
