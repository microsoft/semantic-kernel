    brief: List composite indexes.
    description: List composite indexes.
    examples: |
      The following command lists all composite indexes in the database:

        $ {command}

        $ {command} --database=(default)

      The following command lists composite indexes in the `Events` collection group:

        $ {command} --filter=COLLECTION_GROUP:Events

  request:
    collection: firestore.projects.databases.collectionGroups.indexes

  response:
    id_field: name

  arguments:
    resource:
      help_text: Collection group of the index.

      # By using collection_group_with_default this resource arg is correctly determined to be
      # optional and uses the special '-' collection group to list all indexes in the database.
      spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.firestore.resources:collection_group_with_default
      # Ideally the API would only return indexes whose collection group matches the one in the
      # request; however currently no matter what collection group you provide you'll get a list of
      # all the indexes in all collection groups. Thus we remove the collection group flag here
      # since it has no effect. The user can always filter the responses by collection group using
      # the gcloud wide --filter flag.

  output:
    # This format string gets the field config table (fieldPath,order,arrayConfig) to show up as
    # additional columns in the same row, as opposed to indented on the next line. Note that the
    # double quotes are needed as opposed to a multi-line YAML string, since the latter escapes
    # newline characters which we need to provide to .join() in order to get each field onto its
    # own line.

    #     fields.slice(:-1):format="table(fieldPath,order,arrayConfig)")
    # if we didn't care about the field config info showing up as columns in the existing row.
    #
    # Note fields.slice(:-1) is hiding the special __name__ field returned by the API, since the
    # user shouldn't need to worry about that.
