            asset id.
        - arg_name: resource-name
          help_text: |
            Asset's resource name. Full resource name of the Google Cloud Platform resource
            this asset represents. This field is immutable after create time. See:
            https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name.
            For Example: "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/1234567890123" could be the
            resource-name for a project.
