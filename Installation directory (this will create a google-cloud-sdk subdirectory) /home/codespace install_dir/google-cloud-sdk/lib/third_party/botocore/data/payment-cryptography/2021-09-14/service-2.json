With <code>ExportKey</code> you can export symmetric keys using either symmetric and asymmetric key exchange mechanisms. Using this operation, you can share your Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography generated keys with other service partners to perform cryptographic operations outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography </p> <p>For symmetric key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses the ANSI X9 TR-31 norm in accordance with PCI PIN guidelines. And for asymmetric key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports ANSI X9 TR-34 norm and RSA wrap and unwrap key exchange mechanism. Asymmetric key exchange methods are typically used to establish bi-directional trust between the two parties exhanging keys and are used for initial key exchange such as Key Encryption Key (KEK). After which you can export working keys using symmetric method to perform various cryptographic operations within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.</p> <p>The TR-34 norm is intended for exchanging 3DES keys only and keys are imported in a WrappedKeyBlock format. Key attributes (such as KeyUsage, KeyAlgorithm, KeyModesOfUse, Exportability) are contained within the key block. With RSA wrap and unwrap, you can exchange both 3DES and AES-128 keys. The keys are imported in a WrappedKeyCryptogram format and you will need to specify the key attributes during import. </p> <p>You can also use <code>ExportKey</code> functionality to generate and export an IPEK (Initial Pin Encryption Key) from Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography using either TR-31 or TR-34 export key exchange. IPEK is generated from BDK (Base Derivation Key) and <code>ExportDukptInitialKey</code> attribute KSN (<code>KeySerialNumber</code>). The generated IPEK does not persist within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography and has to be re-generated each time during export.</p> <p> <b>To export initial keys (KEK) or IPEK using TR-34</b> </p> <p>Using this operation, you can export initial key using TR-34 asymmetric key exchange. You can only export KEK generated within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. In TR-34 terminology, the sending party of the key is called Key Distribution Host (KDH) and the receiving party of the key is called Key Receiving Device (KRD). During key export process, KDH is Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography which initiates key export and KRD is the user receiving the key.</p> <p>To initiate TR-34 key export, the KRD must obtain an export token by calling <a>GetParametersForExport</a>. This operation also generates a key pair for the purpose of key export, signs the key and returns back the signing public key certificate (also known as KDH signing certificate) and root certificate chain. The KDH uses the private key to sign the the export payload and the signing public key certificate is provided to KRD to verify the signature. The KRD can import the root certificate into its Hardware Security Module (HSM), as required. The export token and the associated KDH signing certificate expires after 7 days. </p> <p>Next the KRD generates a key pair for the the purpose of encrypting the KDH key and provides the public key cerificate (also known as KRD wrapping certificate) back to KDH. The KRD will also import the root cerificate chain into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling <a>ImportKey</a> for <code>RootCertificatePublicKey</code>. The KDH, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, will use the KRD wrapping cerificate to encrypt (wrap) the key under export and signs it with signing private key to generate a TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock.

In TR-34 terminology, the sending party of the key is called Key Distribution Host (KDH) and the receiving party of the key is called Key Receiving Device (KRD). During the key import process, KDH is the user who initiates the key import and KRD is Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography who receives the key.</p> <p>To initiate TR-34 key import, the KDH must obtain an import token by calling <a>GetParametersForImport</a>. This operation generates an encryption keypair for the purpose of key import, signs the key and returns back the wrapping key certificate (also known as KRD wrapping certificate) and the root certificate chain. The KDH must trust and install the KRD wrapping certificate on its HSM and use it to encrypt (wrap) the KDH key during TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock generation. The import token and associated KRD wrapping certificate expires after 7 days.</p> <p>Next the KDH generates a key pair for the purpose of signing the encrypted KDH key and provides the public certificate of the signing key to Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. The KDH will also need to import the root certificate chain of the KDH signing certificate by calling <code>ImportKey</code> for <code>RootCertificatePublicKey</code>. For more information on TR-34 key import, see section <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/keys-import.html\">Importing symmetric keys</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Set the following parameters:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>KeyMaterial</code>: Use <code>Tr34KeyBlock</code> parameters.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier</code>: The <code>KeyARN</code> of the certificate chain that signed the KDH signing key certificate.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ImportToken</code>: Obtained from KRD by calling <a>GetParametersForImport</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>WrappedKeyBlock</code>: The TR-34 wrapped key material from KDH. It contains the KDH key under import, wrapped with KRD wrapping certificate and signed by KDH signing private key. This TR-34 key block is typically generated by the KDH Hardware Security Module (HSM) outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>SigningKeyCertificate</code>: The public key certificate in PEM format (base64 encoded) of the KDH signing key generated under the root certificate (CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier) imported in Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>To import initial keys (KEK or ZMK or similar) using RSA Wrap and Unwrap</b> </p> <p>Using this operation, you can import initial key using asymmetric RSA wrap and unwrap key exchange method. To initiate import, call <a>GetParametersForImport</a> with <code>KeyMaterial</code> set to <code>KEY_CRYPTOGRAM</code> to generate an import token. This operation also generates an encryption keypair for the purpose of key import, signs the key and returns back the wrapping key certificate in PEM format (base64 encoded) and its root certificate chain. The import token and associated KRD wrapping certificate expires after 7 days. </p> <p>You must trust and install the wrapping certificate and its certificate chain on the sending HSM and use it to wrap the key under export for WrappedKeyCryptogram generation. Next call <code>ImportKey</code> with <code>KeyMaterial</code> set to <code>KEY_CRYPTOGRAM</code> and provide the <code>ImportToken</code> and <code>KeyAttributes</code> for the key under import.</p> <p> <b>To import working keys using TR-31</b> </p> <p>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses TR-31 symmetric key exchange norm to import working keys. A KEK must be established within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by using TR-34 key import or by using <a>CreateKey</a>. To initiate a TR-31 key import, set the following parameters:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>KeyMaterial</code>: Use <code>Tr31KeyBlock</code> parameters.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>WrappedKeyBlock</code>: The TR-31 wrapped key material. It contains the key under import, encrypted using KEK. The TR-31 key block is typically generated by a HSM outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>WrappingKeyIdentifier</code>: The <code>KeyArn</code> of the KEK that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses to decrypt or unwrap the key under import.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Cross-account use:</b> This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> <p> <b>Related operations:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>ExportKey</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetParametersForImport</a> </p> </li> </ul>"
