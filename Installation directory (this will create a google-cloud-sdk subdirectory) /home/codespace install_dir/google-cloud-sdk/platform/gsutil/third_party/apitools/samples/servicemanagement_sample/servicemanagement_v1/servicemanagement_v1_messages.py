    sourceContext: Source context for the protocol buffer service represented

    syntax: The source syntax of the service.
    version: A version string for this api. If specified, must have the form
      `major-version.minor-version`, as in `1.10`. If the minor version is
      omitted, it defaults to zero. If the entire version field is empty, the
      major version is derived from the package name, as outlined below. If
      the field is not empty, the version in the package name will be verified
      to be consistent with what is provided here.  The versioning schema uses
      [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) where the major version number
      indicates a breaking change and the minor version an additive, non-
      breaking change. Both version numbers are signals to users what to
      expect from different versions, and should be carefully chosen based on
      the product plan.  The major version is also reflected in the package
      name of the API, which must end in `v<major-version>`, as in
      `google.feature.v1`. For major versions 0 and 1, the suffix can be
      omitted. Zero major versions must only be used for experimental, none-GA
      apis.

  """

class HttpRule(_messages.Message):
  r"""`HttpRule` defines the mapping of an RPC method to one or more HTTP REST
  APIs.  The mapping determines what portions of the request message are
  populated from the path, query parameters, or body of the HTTP request.  The
  mapping is typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation, see
  "google/api/annotations.proto" for details.  The mapping consists of a field
  specifying the path template and method kind.  The path template can refer
  to fields in the request message, as in the example below which describes a
  REST GET operation on a resource collection of messages:  ```proto service
  Messaging {   rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
  option (google.api.http).get = "/v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}";
  } } message GetMessageRequest {   message SubMessage {     string subfield =
  1;   }   string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL   SubMessage sub = 2;
  // `sub.subfield` is url-mapped } message Message {   string text = 1; //
  content of the resource } ```  This definition enables an automatic,
  bidrectional mapping of HTTP JSON to RPC. Example:  HTTP | RPC -----|-----
  `GET /v1/messages/123456/foo`  | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" sub:
  SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))`  In general, not only fields but also field
  paths can be referenced from a path pattern. Fields mapped to the path
  pattern cannot be repeated and must have a primitive (non-message) type.
  Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path pattern
  automatically become (optional) HTTP query parameters. Assume the following
  definition of the request message:  ```proto message GetMessageRequest {
  message SubMessage {     string subfield = 1;   }   string message_id = 1;
  // mapped to the URL   int64 revision = 2;    // becomes a parameter
  SubMessage sub = 3;    // `sub.subfield` becomes a parameter } ```  This
  enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:  HTTP | RPC -----|----- `GET
  /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` | `GetMessage(message_id:
  "123456" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))`  Note that fields
  which are mapped to HTTP parameters must have a primitive type or a repeated
  primitive type. Message types are not allowed. In the case of a repeated
  type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL, as in `...?param=A&param=B`.
  For HTTP method kinds which allow a request body, the `body` field specifies
  the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the message resource
  collection:  ```proto service Messaging {   rpc
  UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {     option
  (google.api.http) = {       put: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"       body:
  "message"     };   } } message UpdateMessageRequest {   string message_id =
  1; // mapped to the URL   Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body } ```
  The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the representation
  of the JSON in the request body is determined by protos JSON encoding:  HTTP
  | RPC -----|----- `PUT /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` |
  `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })`  The special
  name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that every field not
  bound by the path template should be mapped to the request body.  This
  enables the following alternative definition of the update method:  ```proto
  service Messaging {   rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {
  option (google.api.http) = {       put: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
  body: "*"     };   } } message Message {   string message_id = 1;   string
  text = 2; } ```  The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:  HTTP |
  RPC -----|----- `PUT /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` |
  `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" text: "Hi!")`  Note that when using `*`
  in the body mapping, it is not possible to have HTTP parameters, as all
  fields not bound by the path end in the body. This makes this option more
  rarely used in practice of defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in
  custom methods which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.  It is
  possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using the
  `additional_bindings` option. Example:  ```proto service Messaging {   rpc
  GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {     option
  (google.api.http) = {       get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
  additional_bindings {         get:
  "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"       }     };   } } message
  GetMessageRequest {   string message_id = 1;   string user_id = 2; } ```
  This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:  HTTP
  | RPC -----|----- `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id:
  "123456")` `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me"
  message_id: "123456")`  # Rules for HTTP mapping  The rules for mapping HTTP
  path, query parameters, and body fields to the request message are as
  follows:  1. The `body` field specifies either `*` or a field path, or is
  omitted. If omitted, it assumes there is no HTTP body. 2. Leaf fields
  (recursive expansion of nested messages in the    request) can be classified
  into three types:     (a) Matched in the URL template.     (b) Covered by
  body (if body is `*`, everything except (a) fields;         else everything
  under the body field)     (c) All other fields. 3. URL query parameters
  found in the HTTP request are mapped to (c) fields. 4. Any body sent with an
  HTTP request can contain only (b) fields.  The syntax of the path template
  is as follows:      Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;     Segments =
  Segment { "/" Segment } ;     Segment  = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
  Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;     FieldPath = IDENT { "."
  IDENT } ;     Verb     = ":" LITERAL ;  The syntax `*` matches a single path
  segment. It follows the semantics of [RFC
  6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
  Expansion.  The syntax `**` matches zero or more path segments. It follows
  the semantics of [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section
  3.2.3 Reserved Expansion.  The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the
  URL path.  The syntax `Variable` matches the entire path as specified by its
  template; this nested template must not contain further variables. If a
  variable matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g.
  `{var}` is equivalent to `{var=*}`.  NOTE: the field paths in variables and
  in the `body` must not refer to repeated fields or map fields.  Use
  CustomHttpPattern to specify any HTTP method that is not included in the
  `pattern` field, such as HEAD, or "*" to leave the HTTP method unspecified
  for a given URL path rule. The wild-card rule is useful for services that
  provide content to Web (HTML) clients.

  Fields:
    additionalBindings: Additional HTTP bindings for the selector. Nested

      if the metric type changes, the monitoring data will be discontinued,

  will be inherited   from the original method.  - Each annotation belonging
  to the service config (http,   visibility) which is not set in the
  redeclared method will be   inherited.  - If an http annotation is
  inherited, the path pattern will be   modified as follows. Any version
  prefix will be replaced by the   version of the including API plus the root
  path if specified.  Example of a simple mixin:      package google.acl.v1;

  of a mixin configuration:      apis:     - name: google.storage.v2.Storage
  mixins:       - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl  The mixin construct

class Quota(_messages.Message):
  r"""Quota configuration helps to achieve fairness and budgeting in service
  usage.  - Fairness is achieved through the use of short-term quota limits
  that are usually defined over a time window of several seconds or   minutes.
  When such a limit is applied, for example at the user   level, it ensures
  that no single user will monopolize the service   or a given customer's
  allocated portion of it. - Budgeting is achieved through the use of long-
  term quota limits   that are usually defined over a time window of one or
  more   days. These limits help client application developers predict the
  usage and help budgeting.  Quota enforcement uses a simple token-based
  algorithm for resource sharing.  The quota configuration structure is as
  follows:  - `QuotaLimit` defines a single enforceable limit with a specified
  token amount that can be consumed over a specific duration and   applies to
  a particular entity, like a project or an end user. If   the limit applies
  to a user, each user making the request will   get the specified number of
  tokens to consume. When the tokens   run out, the requests from that user
  will be blocked until the   duration elapses and the next duration window
  starts.  - `QuotaGroup` groups a set of quota limits.  - `QuotaRule` maps a
  method to a set of quota groups. This allows   sharing of quota groups
  across methods as well as one method   consuming tokens from more than one
  quota group. When a group   contains multiple limits, requests to a method
  consuming tokens   from that group must satisfy all the limits in that
  group.  Example:      quota:       groups:       - name: ReadGroup
  limits:         - description: Daily Limit           name: ProjectQpd
  default_limit: 10000           duration: 1d           limit_by:

  cost: 2       - selector: google.calendar.Calendar.Delete         groups:
  - group: WriteGroup  Here, the configuration defines two quota groups:
  ReadGroup and WriteGroup, each defining its own daily and per-second limits.
  Note that One Platform enforces per-second limits averaged over a duration
  of 100 seconds. The rules map ReadGroup for all methods, except for the
  Update and Delete methods. These two methods consume from WriteGroup, with
  Update method consuming at twice the rate as Delete method.  Multiple quota
  groups can be specified for a method. The quota limits in all of those
  groups will be enforced. Example:      quota:       groups:       - name:
  WriteGroup         limits:         - description: Daily Limit
  name: ProjectQpd           default_limit: 1000           max_limit: 1000

  StorageGroup  In the above example, the Create and Delete methods manage the
  user's storage space. In addition, Create method uses WriteGroup to manage
  the requests. In this case, requests to Create method need to satisfy all
  quota limits defined in both quota groups.  One can disable quota for
  selected method(s) identified by the selector by setting disable_quota to
  ture. For example,        rules:       - selector: "*"         group:

      IDL during the normalization process. It is an error to specify an API
      interface here which cannot be resolved against the associated IDL
      files.
    authentication: Auth configuration.
    backend: API backend configuration.
    billing: Billing configuration of the service.
    configVersion: The version of the service configuration. The config
      version may influence interpretation of the configuration, for example,
      to determine defaults. This is documented together with applicable
      options. The current default for the config version itself is `3`.
    context: Context configuration.
    control: Configuration for the service control plane.

      be listed here by name. Example:      enums:     - name:
      google.someapi.v1.SomeEnum
    http: HTTP configuration.
    id: A unique ID for a specific instance of this message, typically
      assigned by the client for tracking purpose. If empty, the server may
      choose to generate one instead.
    logging: Logging configuration of the service.
    logs: Defines the logs used by this service.
    metrics: Defines the metrics used by this service.
    monitoredResources: Defines the monitored resources used by this service.
      This is required by the Service.monitoring and Service.logging

      manage consumption of the service, etc.
    projectProperties: Configuration of per-consumer project properties.
    quota: Quota configuration.

class Status(_messages.Message):
  r"""The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
  used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
  - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet
  unexpected needs  # Overview  The `Status` message contains three pieces of
  data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be
  an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes
  if needed.  The error message should be a developer-facing English message
  that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized
  user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error
  details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain
  arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error
  detail types in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error
  conditions.  # Language mapping  The `Status` message is the logical
  representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire
  format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries
  and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it
  will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to
  some error codes in C.  # Other uses  The error model and the `Status`
  message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without
  APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different
  environments.  Example uses of this error model include:  - Partial errors.
  If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,     it may embed
  the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial     errors.  -
  Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
  have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.  - Batch operations. If
  a client uses batch request and batch response, the     `Status` message
  should be used directly inside batch response, one for     each error sub-
  response.  - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous
  operation     results in its response, the status of those operations should
  be     represented directly using the `Status` message.  - Logging. If some
  API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could     be used
  directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
