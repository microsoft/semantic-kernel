# documentsignoffstate.pystate
#
# state machine model of the states and associated behaviors and properties for each
# different state of a document in a document control system
#
# example using named state transitions

# This implements a state model for submitting,
# approving, activating, and purging document 
# revisions in a document management system.
#
# The state model looks like:
#
#   New
#    |
#    | (create)
#    |
#    v 
#   Editing ----------------------------------------------+
#    |   ^                                                |
