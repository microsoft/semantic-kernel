[Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/)
is an SDK that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) like
[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction),
[Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service),
and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
with conventional programming languages like C#, Python, and Java. Semantic Kernel achieves this
by allowing you to define [plugins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/plugins)
that can be chained together
in just a [few lines of code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/chaining-functions?tabs=Csharp#using-the-runasync-method-to-simplify-your-code).

What makes Semantic Kernel _special_, however, is its ability to _automatically_ orchestrate
plugins with AI. With Semantic Kernel
[planners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/planner), you
can ask an LLM to generate a plan that achieves a user's unique goal. Afterwards,
Semantic Kernel will execute the plan for the user.

It provides:

- abstractions for AI services (such as chat, text to images, audio to text, etc.) and memory stores
- implementations of those abstractions for services from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction), [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), local models, and more, and for a multitude of vector databases, such as those from [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/getting-started), [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/), [Milvus](https://milvus.io/), and [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search)
- a common representation for [plugins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/plugins), which can then be orchestrated automatically by AI
- the ability to create such plugins from a multitude of sources, including from OpenAPI specifications, prompts, and arbitrary code written in the target language
- extensible support for prompt management and rendering, including built-in handling of common formats like Handlebars and Liquid
- and a wealth of functionality layered on top of these abstractions, such as filters for responsible AI, dependency injection integration, and more.

Semantic Kernel is utilized by enterprises due to its flexibility, modularity and observability. Backed with security enhancing capabilities like telemetry support, and hooks and filters so youâ€™ll feel confident youâ€™re delivering responsible AI solutions at scale.
Semantic Kernel was designed to be future proof, easily connecting your code to the latest AI models evolving with the technology as it advances. When new models are released, youâ€™ll simply swap them out without needing to rewrite your entire codebase.

## Getting started with Semantic Kernel

The Semantic Kernel SDK is available in C#, Python, and Java. To get started, choose your preferred language below. See the [Feature Matrix](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/get-started/supported-languages) for a breakdown of
feature parity between our currently supported languages.

The quickest way to get started with the basics is to get an API key
from either OpenAI or Azure OpenAI and to run one of the C#, Python, and Java console applications/scripts below.

### For C#:

1. Go to the Quick start page [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/get-started/quick-start-guide?pivots=programming-language-csharp) and follow the steps to dive in.
2. After Installing the SDK, we advise you follow the steps and code detailed to write your first console app.

### For Python:

1. Go to the Quick start page [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/get-started/quick-start-guide?pivots=programming-language-python) and follow the steps to dive in.
2. You'll need to ensure that you toggle to Python in the the Choose a programming language table at the top of the page.

### For Java:

The Java code is in the [semantic-kernel-java](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel-java) repository. See
[semantic-kernel-java build](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel-java/blob/main/BUILD.md) for instructions on
how to build and run the Java code.

Please file Java Semantic Kernel specific issues in
the [semantic-kernel-java](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel-java) repository.

## Learning how to use Semantic Kernel

The fastest way to learn how to use Semantic Kernel is with our C# and Python Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks
demonstrate how to use Semantic Kernel with code snippets that you can run with a push of a button.

- [Getting Started with C# notebook](dotnet/notebooks/00-getting-started.ipynb)
