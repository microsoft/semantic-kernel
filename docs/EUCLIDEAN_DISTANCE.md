# Euclidean Distance

Euclidean distance is a mathematical concept that measures the straight-line distance
between two points in a Euclidean space. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician
Euclid, who is often referred to as the "father of geometry". The formula for calculating
Euclidean distance is based on the Pythagorean Theorem and can be expressed as:

$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

For higher dimensions, this formula can be generalized to:

$$d(p, q) = \sqrt{\sum\limits_{i\=1}^{n} (q_i - p_i)^2}$$

Euclidean distance has many applications in computer science and artificial intelligence,
particularly when working with [embeddings](EMBEDDINGS.md). Embeddings are numerical
representations of data that capture the underlying structure and relationships
between different data points. They are commonly used in natural language processing,
computer vision, and recommendation systems.

When working with embeddings, it is often necessary to measure the similarity or
dissimilarity between different data points. This is where Euclidean distance comes
into play. By calculating the Euclidean distance between two embeddings, we can
determine how similar or dissimilar they are.

One common use case for Euclidean distance in AI is in clustering algorithms such
as K-means. In this algorithm, data points are grouped together based on their proximity
to one another in a multi-dimensional space. The Euclidean distance between each
point and the centroid of its cluster is used to determine which points belong to
which cluster.

Another use case for Euclidean distance is in recommendation systems. By calculating
the Euclidean distance between different items' embeddings, we can determine how
similar they are and make recommendations based on that information.

Overall, Euclidean distance is an essential tool for software developers working
with AI and embeddings. It provides a simple yet powerful way to measure the similarity
or dissimilarity between different data points in a multi-dimensional space.

# Applications

Some examples about Euclidean distance applications.

1. Recommender systems: Euclidean distance can be used to measure the similarity
   between items in a recommender system, helping to provide more accurate recommendations.

2. Image recognition: By calculating the Euclidean distance between image embeddings,
   it is possible to identify similar images or detect duplicates.

3. Natural Language Processing: Measuring the distance between word embeddings can
   help with tasks such as semantic similarity and word sense disambiguation.

4. Clustering: Euclidean distance is commonly used as a metric for clustering algorithms,
   allowing them to group similar data points together.

5. Anomaly detection: By calculating the distance between data points, it is possible
   to identify outliers or anomalies in a dataset.
