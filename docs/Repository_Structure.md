- `docs/`: Contains detailed documentation for each major component of the repository.
- `java/`: Contains the Java implementation of the Semantic Kernel.
- `dotnet/`: Contains the .NET implementation of the Semantic Kernel.
- `python/`: Contains the Python implementation of the Semantic Kernel.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.

## `docs/` Directory

The `docs/` directory contains detailed documentation for each major component of the repository. The documentation is organized into the following sections:

- `samples/`: Contains sample code and examples for using the .NET implementation.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the .NET implementation and instructions for getting started.

## `python/` Directory

The `python/` directory contains the Python implementation of the Semantic Kernel. It includes the following subdirectories:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the Python implementation.
- `samples/`: Contains sample code and examples for using the Python implementation.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the Python implementation and instructions for getting started.

## Diagrams and Visual Aids

To help users understand the structure of the repository, we have included diagrams and visual aids. These diagrams provide a visual representation of the repository's organization and highlight the relationships between different components.
