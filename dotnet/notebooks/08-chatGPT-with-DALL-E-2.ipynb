    "# Using ChatGPT with the Semantic Kernel featuring DALL-E 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to make use of the new ChatCompletion API from OpenAI, popularized by ChatGPT. This API brings a new ChatML schema which is different from the TextCompletion API. While the text completion API expects input a prompt and returns a simple string, the chat completion API expects in input a Chat history and returns a new message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "messages=[\n",
    "    { \"role\": \"system\",    \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n",
    "    { \"role\": \"user\",      \"content\": \"Who won the world series in 2020?\"},\n",
    "    { \"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020.\"},\n",
    "    { \"role\": \"user\",      \"content\": \"Where was it played?\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are three message types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A System message is used to give instructions to the chat model, e.g. setting the context and the kind of conversation your app is offering.\n",
    "2. User messages store the data received from the user of your app.\n",
    "3. Assistant messages store the replies generated by the LLM model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your app is responsible for adding information to the chat history and maintaining this object. The Chat Completion API is stateless, and returns only new messages, that your app can use, e.g. to execute commands, generate images, or simply continue the conversation."
