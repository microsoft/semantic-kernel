## About Semantic Kernel

Semantic Kernel is a lightweight SDK that offers a simple, powerful, and consistent programming
model mixing classical code with AI and "semantic" functions, covering multiple programming
languages and platforms.

Semantic Kernel is designed to support and encapsulate several design patterns from the latest
in AI research such that developers can infuse their applications with complex skills like prompt
chaining, recursive reasoning, summarization, zero/few-shot learning, contextual memory,
long-term memory, embeddings, semantic indexing, planning, and accessing external knowledge
stores as well as your own data.
