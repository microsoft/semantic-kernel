        1. "The Greeks" by H.D.F. Kitto - This is a classic book that provides an overview of ancient Greek history and culture, including their philosophy, literature, and art.

        2. "The Republic" by Plato - This is one of the most famous works of philosophy in the Western world, and it explores the nature of justice and the ideal society.

        3. "The Peloponnesian War" by Thucydides - This is a detailed account of the war between Athens and Sparta in the 5th century BCE, and it provides insight into the political and military strategies of the time.

        4. "The Iliad" by Homer - This epic poem tells the story of the Trojan War and is considered one of the greatest works of literature in the Western canon.

        5. "The Histories" by Herodotus - This is a comprehensive account of the Persian Wars and provides a wealth of information about ancient Greek culture and society.

        I hope these suggestions are helpful!
