# Native-AOT Samples
This application demonstrates how to use the Semantic Kernel Native-AOT compatible API in a Native-AOT application.

## Running Samples
The samples be run either in a debug mode by just setting a break point and pressing `F5` in Visual Studio (make sure the `AotCompatibility` project is set as the startup project) in which case they are run in a regular CoreCLR application and not in Native-AOT one. This might be useful to understand how the API works and how to use it.

To run the samples in a Native-AOT application, first publish it using the following command: `dotnet publish -r win-x64`. Then, execute the application by running the following command in the terminal: `.\bin\Release\net8.0\win-x64\publish\AotCompatibility.exe`.  

## Samples
Most of the samples don't require any additional setup, and can be run as is. However, some of them might require additional configuration.

### 1. [ONNX Chat Completion Service](./OnnxChatCompletionSamples.cs)
To configure the sample, you need to download the ONNX model from the Hugging Face repository. Go to a directory of your choice where the model should be downloaded and run the following command:
```powershell
git clone https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-onnx
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
The `Phi-3` model may be too large to download using the `git clone` command unless you have the [git-lfs extension](https://git-lfs.com/) installed. 
You might need to download it manually using the following link: [Phi-3-Mini-4k CPU](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-onnx/resolve/main/cpu_and_mobile/cpu-int4-rtn-block-32/phi3-mini-4k-instruct-cpu-int4-rtn-block-32.onnx.data?download=true) (approximately 2.7 GB).

After downloading the model, you need to configure the sample by setting the `Onnx:ModelPath` and `Onnx:ModelId` secrets. 
The `Onnx:ModelPath` should point to the directory where the model was downloaded, and the `Onnx:ModelId` should be set to `phi-3`.
The secrets can be set using [Secret Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets#secret-manager) in the following way:
```powershell
dotnet user-secrets set "Onnx:ModelId" "phi-3"
dotnet user-secrets set "Onnx:ModelPath" "C:\path\to\huggingface\Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-onnx\cpu_and_mobile\cpu-int4-rtn-block-32" 
```

### AOT Compatibility
At the moment, the following Semantic Kernel packages are AOT compatible:

| Package                   | AOT compatible |  
|--------------------------|----------------|  
| SemanticKernel.Abstractions | ✔️              |  
| SemanticKernel.Core         | ✔️              |  
| Connectors.Onnx            | ✔️              |  

Other packages are not AOT compatible yet, but we plan to make them compatible in the future.

### Known Issues
#### 1. KernelFunction JSON Schema
Semantic Kernel uses System.Text.Json (STJ) v8 to generate JSON schemas for the parameters and return types of kernel plugin functions.

However, because STJ v8 uses reflection to resolve certain metadata, such as nullability annotations and constructor parameters,
it produces an incorrect JSON Schema in Native-AOT scenarios. For more details, see the following issue: [Incorrect type schema ...](https://github.com/eiriktsarpalis/stj-schema-mapper/issues/7).

This issue can be worked around by disabling the `IlcTrimMetadata` property in the application's project; however, this may increase the size of the application.
