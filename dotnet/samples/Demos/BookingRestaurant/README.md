# Booking Restaurant - Demo Application

This sample provides a practical demonstration of how to leverage features from the [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel) to build a console application. Specifically, the application utilizes the [Business Schedule and Booking API](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/scheduling-and-booking-app) through Microsoft Graph to enable a Large Language Model (LLM) to book restaurant appointments efficiently. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to integrate these technologies seamlessly.

## Semantic Kernel Features Used

- [Plugin](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/main/dotnet/src/SemanticKernel.Abstractions/Functions/KernelPlugin.cs) - Creating a Plugin from a native C# Booking class to be used by the Kernel to interact with Bookings API.
- [Chat Completion Service](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/main/dotnet/src/SemanticKernel.Abstractions/AI/ChatCompletion/IChatCompletionService.cs) - Using the Chat Completion Service [OpenAI Connector implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/main/dotnet/src/Connectors/Connectors.OpenAI/Services/OpenAIChatCompletionService.cs) to generate responses from the LLM.
- [Chat History](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/main/dotnet/src/SemanticKernel.Abstractions/AI/ChatCompletion/ChatHistory.cs) Using the Chat History abstraction to create, update and retrieve chat history from Chat Completion Models.
- [Auto Function Calling](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/main/dotnet/samples/Concepts/ChatCompletion/OpenAI_FunctionCalling.cs) Enables the LLM to have knowledge of current importedUsing the Function Calling feature automatically call the Booking Plugin from the LLM.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).
- [Microsoft 365 Business License](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products) to use [Business Schedule and Booking API](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/scheduling-and-booking-app).
- [Azure Entra Id](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id) administrator account to register an application and set the necessary credentials and permissions.

ℹ️ OpenAI Models older than 0613 version do not support function calling.

ℹ️ When using Azure OpenAI, ensure that the model name of your deployment matches any of the above supported models names.

## Configuring the sample

The sample can be configured by using the command line with .NET [Secret Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) to avoid the risk of leaking secrets into the repository, branches and pull requests.

### Create an App Registration in Azure Active Directory

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Select the Azure Active Directory service.
3. Select App registrations and click on New registration.
4. Fill in the required fields and click on Register.
5. Copy the Application **(client) Id** for later use.
6. Save Directory **(tenant) Id** for later use..
7. Click on Certificates & secrets and create a new client secret. (Any name and expiration date will work)
8. Copy the **client secret** value for later use.
9. Click on API permissions and add the following permissions:
   - Microsoft Graph
     - Application permissions
       - BookingsAppointment.ReadWrite.All
     - Delegated permissions
       - OpenId permissions
