Semantic Kernel is a lightweight, open-source development kit that lets you easily build AI agents and integrate the latest AI models into your C#, Python, or Java codebase. It serves as an efficient middleware that enables rapid delivery of enterprise-grade solutions.
Semantic Kernel is a new AI SDK, and a simple and yet powerful programming model that lets you add large language capabilities to your app in just a matter of minutes. It uses natural language prompting to create and execute semantic kernel AI tasks across multiple languages and platforms.
In this guide, you learned how to quickly get started with Semantic Kernel by building a simple AI agent that can interact with an AI service and run your code. To see more examples and learn how to build more complex AI agents, check out our in-depth samples.
The Semantic Kernel extension for Visual Studio Code makes it easy to design and test semantic functions. The extension provides an interface for designing semantic functions and allows you to test them with the push of a button with your existing models and data.
The kernel is the central component of Semantic Kernel. At its simplest, the kernel is a Dependency Injection container that manages all of the services and plugins necessary to run your AI application.
Semantic Kernel (SK) is a lightweight SDK that lets you mix conventional programming languages, like C# and Python, with the latest in Large Language Model (LLM) AI “prompts” with prompt templating, chaining, and planning capabilities.
Semantic Kernel is a lightweight, open-source development kit that lets you easily build AI agents and integrate the latest AI models into your C#, Python, or Java codebase. It serves as an efficient middleware that enables rapid delivery of enterprise-grade solutions. Enterprise ready.
With Semantic Kernel, you can easily build agents that can call your existing code. This power lets you automate your business processes with models from OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face, and more! We often get asked though, “How do I architect my solution?” and “How does it actually work?”
Semantic Kernel for Java is an open source library that empowers developers to harness the power of AI while coding in Java. It is compatible with Java 8 and above, ensuring flexibility and accessibility to a wide range of Java developers.
Semantic Kernel enables developers to easily blend cutting-edge AI with native code, opening up a world of new possibilities for AI applications. This article could go on to discuss...
Semantic Kernel distinguishes between semantic functions, templated prompts, and native functions, i.e. the native computer code that processes data for use in the LLM’s semantic functions.
Semantic Kernel (SK) is a lightweight SDK enabling integration of AI Large Language Models (LLMs) with conventional programming languages. The SK extensible programming model combines natural language semantic functions, traditional code native functions, and embeddings-based memory unlocking new potential and adding value to applications with AI.
So what is Semantic Kernel? We also call it SK as an abbreviation. It is a lightweight SDK software development kit. Lightweight is super important because the last thing you want to do is...
Semantic Kernel documentation. Learn to build robust, future-proof AI solutions that evolve with technological advancements.
Prompt Templates. Chat Prompting. Filtering. Dependency Injection. A Glimpse into the Getting Started Steps: In the guide below we’ll start from scratch and navigate with you through each of the example steps, clarifying the code, details and running them in real time.
Using Semantic Kernel and Kernel Memory together can greatly accelerate the time to deliver new AI solutions. Here’s how: Rapid Prototyping: The modular and extensible nature of Semantic Kernel allows you to quickly prototype and test new features. You can integrate existing code and leverage out-of-the-box connectors to build functional ...
The semantic kernel (SK) is this beautiful orchestrator that passes the ball between the model and available plugins, thus producing the desired output by getting a collaborative effort.
The kernel integrates the OpenAI chat completion interface for generating chat responses and manages plugin execution for custom functionalities. Host Instructions. In the context of the Semantic Kernel, prompt instructions serve as a guiding light for the LLM, influencing its decision-making process when choosing the appropriate plugin to execute.
Semantic Kernel is a powerful and recommended choice for working with AI in .NET applications. In the sections ahead, you learn: How to add semantic kernel to your project. Semantic Kernel core concepts. The sections ahead serve as an introductory overview of Semantic Kernel specifically in the context of .NET.
This monthly beginner series will walk through the fundamentals of using Semantic Kernel SDK to build intelligent applications that automate tasks and performance
Semantic Kernel (SK) is a lightweight SDK that lets you mix conventional programming languages, like C# and Python, with the latest in Large Language Model (LLM) AI “prompts” with prompt templating, chaining, and planning capabilities. Its Planner Skill allows users to create and execute plans based on semantic queries.
Semantic Kernel provides a wide range of integrations to help you build powerful AI agents. These integrations include AI services, memory connectors. Additionally, Semantic Kernel integrates with other Microsoft services to provide additional functionality via plugins.
Filesystems in the Linux kernel ¶. Filesystems in the Linux kernel. ¶. This under-development manual will, some glorious day, provide comprehensive information on how the Linux virtual filesystem (VFS) layer works, along with the filesystems that sit below it. For now, what we have can be found below.
Semantic Kernel allows prompts to be automatically converted to ChatHistory instances. Developers can create prompts which include <message> tags and ...
Anatomy of a plugin. At a high-level, a plugin is a group of functions that can be exposed to AI apps and services. The functions within plugins can then be orchestrated by an AI application to accomplish user requests. Within Semantic Kernel, you can invoke these functions automatically with function calling. Note.
The biggest benefit of having a dedicated connector for Ollama is that it allows us to support Semantic Kernel features that targeted for Ollama deployed models. What is Ollama? Ollama is an open-source MIT license platform that facilitates the local operation of AI models directly on personal or corporate hardware.
