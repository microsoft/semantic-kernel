    "TextToSummarize": "HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS When selecting a health insurance plan, one of the most important factors to consider is the network of in-network providers that are available with the plan.  Northwind Standard offers a wide variety of in-network providers, ranging from primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This allows you to choose a provider that is convenient for you and your family, while also helping you to keep your costs low.  When you choose a provider that is in-network with your plan, you will typically pay lower copays and deductibles than you would with an out-of-network provider. In addition, many services, such as preventive care, may be covered at no cost when you receive care from an in-network provider.  It is important to note, however, that Northwind Standard does not offer coverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network services. This means that you may have to pay out of pocket for these services if you receive them from an out-of-network provider.  When choosing an in-network provider, there are a few tips to keep in mind. First, make sure that the provider you choose is in-network with your plan. You can confirm this by calling the provider's office and asking them if they are in-network with Northwind Standard. You can also use the provider search tool on the Northwind Health website to make sure your provider is in-network.  Second, make sure that the provider you choose is accepting new patients. Some providers may be in-network but not be taking new patients.  Third, consider the location of the provider. If the provider is too far away, it may be difficult for you to get to your appointments.  Finally, consider the provider's office hours. If you work during the day, you may need to find a provider that has evening or weekend hours.  Choosing an in-network provider can help you save money on your health care costs. By following the tips above and researching your options, you can find a provider that is convenient, affordable, and in-network with your Northwind Standard plan."
