# Starting With Semantic Kernel

This project contains a step by step guide to get started with the Semantic Kernel.

The examples can be run as integration tests but their code can also be copied to stand-alone programs.

## Configuring Secrets

Most of the examples will require secrets and credentials, to access OpenAI, Azure OpenAI,
Bing and other resources. We suggest using .NET
[Secret Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets)
to avoid the risk of leaking secrets into the repository, branches and pull requests.
You can also use environment variables if you prefer.

To set your secrets with Secret Manager:

```
cd dotnet/samples/Concepts

dotnet user-secrets init

dotnet user-secrets set "OpenAI:ModelId" "..."
dotnet user-secrets set "OpenAI:ChatModelId" "..."
dotnet user-secrets set "OpenAI:EmbeddingModelId" "..."
dotnet user-secrets set "OpenAI:ApiKey" "..."

```

To set your secrets with environment variables, use these names:

```
# OpenAI
OpenAI__ModelId
OpenAI__ChatModelId
OpenAI__EmbeddingModelId
OpenAI__ApiKey
```
