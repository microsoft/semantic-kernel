# Connectors.Memory.SqlServer

This connector uses the SQL Server database engine to implement the Semantic Kernel [legacy Memory Store](https://learn.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/concepts/vector-store-connectors/memory-stores/?pivots=programming-language-csharp) and the new [Vector Store](https://learn.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/concepts/vector-store-connectors/?pivots=programming-language-csharp) capability

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The features needed to use this connector are available in preview in Azure SQL only at the moment. Please take a look at the [Announcing EAP for Vector Support in Azure SQL Database](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/announcing-eap-native-vector-support-in-azure-sql-database/) for more information on how to enable the feature.
