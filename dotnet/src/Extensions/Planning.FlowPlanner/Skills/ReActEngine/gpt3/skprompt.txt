[INSTRUCTION]
Answer the following questions as accurately as possible using the provided functions.

[AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS]
The function definitions below are in the following format:
<functionName>: <description>
 - <parameterName>: <parameterDescription>
 - ...

{{$functionDescriptions}}
[END AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS]

[USAGE INSTRUCTIONS]
To use the functions, specify a JSON blob representing an action. The JSON blob should contain fully qualified name of the function to use, and an "action_variables" key with a JSON object of string values to use when calling the function.
Do not call functions directly; they must be invoked through an action.
The "action_variables" values should match the defined [PARAMETERS] of the named "action" in [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS].
Dictionary values in "action_variables" must be strings and represent the actual values to be passed to the function.
Ensure that the $JSON_BLOB contains only a SINGLE action; do NOT return multiple actions.
IMPORTANT: Use only the available functions listed in the [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] section. Do not attempt to use any other functions that are not specified.
The value of parameters should either by empty if the expectation is for the user to provide them and have not been provided yet, or derived from the agent scratchpad.
You are not allowed to ask user directly for more information.

Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:
```
{
  "action": "_Namespace_.FUNCTION.NAME",
  "action_variables": {"PARAMETER_NAME_1": "some value", "PARAMETER_NAME_2": "42"}
}
```

[THOUGHT PROCESS]
[QUESTION]
The input question I must answer
[THOUGHT]
To solve this problem, I should carefully analyze the given question and identify the necessary steps. Any facts I discover earlier in my thought process should be repeated here to keep them readily available.
If there is function which can be leveraged for validation, use it in ACTION before jumping into FINAL ANSWER.
[ACTION]
$JSON_BLOB
[OBSERVATION]
The result of the action will be provided here. It could be result or error message of the action, or chat history between assistant and user to tackle the problem.
... (These THOUGHT/ACTION/OBSERVATION can repeat until the final answer is reached.)
[FINAL ANSWER]
Once I have gathered all the necessary observations and performed any required actions, if there is a suitable function for validation, provide the final answer in JSON in the following format:
{ "action": "$(last_action_name)", "action_variables": {"INPUT": "some input", "PARAMETER_NAME": "some value", "PARAMETER_NAME_2": "42"}}
If there is not a fitting function available to validate the result, I can provide the final answer in a clear and human-readable format.
[END THOUGHT PROCESS]

Example:
[Question]
Get the half of 80.
[THOUGHT]
I should use Calculator.Divide function to calculate the result.
[ACTION]
{
    "action": "Calculator.Divide",
    "action_variables": {
        "param1": "80",
        "param2": "2"
    }
}

IMPORTANT REMINDER: your each response should contain only one next step and only single one [ACTION] part. Do not provide more than one step.  
Let's break down the problem step by step and think about the best approach.
