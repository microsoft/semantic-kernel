He’d seen countless storms, each one a furious dance of wind and wave, but tonight felt different, a simmering unease prickling his skin. The lantern, his steadfast companion, pulsed its rhythmic beam, a fragile defiance against the encroaching darkness. A small boat, barely visible through the swirling mist, was bucking against the tide, its lone mast a broken finger pointing towards the sky. Silas grabbed his oilskins, his movements stiff with age, and descended the winding stairs, his heart thumping a frantic rhythm against his ribs. He knew the sea’s capriciousness, its ability to lull and then lash out with brutal force. He had to reach them, whoever they were, before the ocean claimed another victim, its greedy maw always hungry for more. The salty air stung his eyes as he launched his small rescue craft, each oar stroke a determined push against the relentless tide, his gaze fixed on that fragile speck of hope battling the storm. The distant cries, thin and desperate, spurred him onward, the lantern’s beam his guiding star in the swirling chaos.

He’d seen countless storms, each one a furious dance of wind and wave, but tonight felt different, a simmering unease prickling his skin. The lantern, his steadfast companion, pulsed its rhythmic beam, a fragile defiance against the encroaching darkness. A small boat, barely visible through the swirling mist, was bucking against the tide, its lone mast a broken finger pointing towards the sky.

He had to reach them, whoever they were, before the ocean claimed another victim, its greedy maw always hungry for more. The salty air stung his eyes as he launched his small rescue craft, each oar stroke a determined push against the relentless tide, his gaze fixed on that fragile speck of hope battling the storm.
