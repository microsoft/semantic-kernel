          "text": "The old lighthouse keeper, Silas, squinted at the churning grey sea, his weathered face mirroring the granite rocks below. He’d seen countless storms, each one a furious dance of wind and wave, but tonight felt different, a simmering unease prickling his skin. The lantern, his steadfast companion, pulsed its rhythmic beam, a fragile defiance against the encroaching darkness. A small boat, barely visible through the swirling mist, was bucking against the tide, its lone mast a broken finger pointing towards the sky. Silas grabbed his oilskins, his movements stiff with age, and descended the winding stairs, his heart thumping a frantic rhythm against his ribs. He knew the sea’s capriciousness, its ability to lull and then lash out with brutal force."
