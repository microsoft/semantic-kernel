[INSTRUCTION]
Answer the following questions as accurately as possible using the provided functions.

{{$functionDescriptions}}
[USAGE INSTRUCTIONS]
To use the functions, specify a JSON blob representing an action. The JSON blob should contain an "action" key with the name of the function to use, and an "action_variables" key with a JSON object of string values to use when calling the function.
Do not call functions directly; they must be invoked through an action.
The keys in "action_variables" value should match the defined [PARAMETERS] of the named "action" in [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS].
The values in "action_variables" must be of type string and represent the actual values to be passed to the function. Do not attempt to pass a variable name or other reference to a function.
If a function has no parameters, the "action_variables" key may be omitted.
Ensure that the $JSON_BLOB contains only a SINGLE action; do NOT return multiple actions.
IMPORTANT: Use only the available functions listed in the [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] section. Do not attempt to use any other functions that are not specified.

Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:
{
  "action": "FUNCTION.NAME",
  "action_variables": {"PARAMETER_NAME": "some value", "PARAMETER_NAME_2": "42"}
}

Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB with no parameters:
{
  "action": "FUNCTION.NAME"
}
