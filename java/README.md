# Semantic Kernel for Java

The Semantic Kernel for Java code has moved
to [semantic-kernel-java](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel-java), please make code changes and submit issues
to that repository. This move is purely to ease the development. The various Semantic Kernel languages are all still 
aligned in their development.

Project coordination is still performed within this [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/projects/866).
