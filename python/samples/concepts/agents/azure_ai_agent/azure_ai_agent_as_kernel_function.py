            steps you can take:

    1. **Check Cancellation Confirmation**: Make sure you received a confirmation of your cancellation. 
        This usually comes via email.

    2. **Billing Cycle**: Review your billing cycle to confirm whether the charge aligns with your subscription terms. 
        If your billing is monthly, charges can occur even if you cancel before the period ends.

    3. **Contact Support**: If you believe the charge was made in error, please reach out to customer support for 
        further clarification and to rectify the situation.

    If you can provide more details about the subscription and when you canceled it, I can help you further understand 
        the charges.
