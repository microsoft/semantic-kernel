The following sample demonstrates how to create a simple,               
Azure AI agent that uses the Azure AI Search tool and the demo          
hotels-sample-index to answer questions about hotels.                   
                                                                        
This sample requires:                                                   
- A "Standard" Agent Setup (choose the Python (Azure SDK) tab):         
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart   
- An Azure AI Search index named 'hotels-sample-index' created in your  
Azure AI Search service. You may follow this guide to create the index: 
https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-portal
- You will need to make sure your Azure AI Agent project is set up with
the required Knowledge Source to be able to use the Azure AI Search tool.
Refer to the following link for information on how to do this: 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/azure-ai-search

Refer to the README for information about configuring the index to work
with the sample data model in Azure AI Search.
