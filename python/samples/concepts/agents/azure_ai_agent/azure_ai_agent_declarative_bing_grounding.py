"""
The following sample demonstrates how to create an Azure AI agent that answers
user questions using the Bing Grounding tool.

The agent is created using a YAML declarative spec that configures the
Bing Grounding tool. The agent is then used to answer user questions
that require web search to answer correctly.

Note: the `BingConnectionId` is in the format of:
/subscriptions/<sub_id>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspace>/connections/<bing_connection_id>

It can either be configured as an env var `AZURE_AI_AGENT_BING_CONNECTION_ID` or passed in as an extra to 
`create_from_yaml`: extras={"BingConnectionId": "<bing_connection_id>"}
