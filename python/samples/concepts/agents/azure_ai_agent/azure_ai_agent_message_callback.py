"""
This sample demonstrates how to create an Azure AI Agent and invoke it using the non-streaming `invoke()` method.

While `invoke()` returns only the final assistant message, the agent can optionally emit intermediate messages
(e.g., function calls and results) via a callback by supplying `on_intermediate_message`.

In this example, the agent is configured with a plugin that provides menu specials and item pricing. As the user
asks about the menu, the agent performs tool calls mid-invocation, and those intermediate steps are surfaced
via the callback function while the invocation is still in progress.
