    Sample Output:

    # User: Why is the sky blue?
    # TruncateAgent: The sky appears blue because molecules in the Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight in all 
        directions, and blue light is scattered more than other colors due to its shorter wavelength.
    # User: What is the speed of light?
    # TruncateAgent: The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second 
        (or about 186,282 miles per second).
    # User: What have we been talking about?
    # TruncateAgent: I'm sorry, but I don't have access to previous interactions. Could you remind me what 
        we've been discussing?
