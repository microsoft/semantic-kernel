"""
This sample shows how to use a bedrock agent in a group chat that includes multiple agents of different roles.
This sample uses the following main component(s):
- a Bedrock agent
- a ChatCompletionAgent
- an AgentGroupChat
You will learn how to create a new or connect to an existing Bedrock agent and put it in a group chat with
another agent.
