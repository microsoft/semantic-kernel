"""
The following sample demonstrates how to create a chat completion agent
and use it with functions. In order to answer user questions, the
agent internally uses the functions. These internal steps are returned
to the user as part of the agent's response. Thus, the invoke method
configures a message callback to receive the agent's internal messages. 

The agent is configured to use a plugin that provides a list of
specials from the menu and the price of the requested menu item.
