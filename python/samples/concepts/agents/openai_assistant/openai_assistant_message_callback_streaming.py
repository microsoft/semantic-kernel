The following sample demonstrates how to create an Assistant Agent
using either OpenAI or Azure OpenAI resources and use it with streaming
responses. Additionally, the invoke_stream configures a message callback 
to receive fully formed messages once the streaming invocation is complete.
The agent is configured to use a plugin that provides a list of specials
from the menu and the price of the requested menu item.
