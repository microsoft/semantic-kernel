"""
This sample demonstrates how to create an AzureAssistantAgent/OpenAIAssistantAgent and use it with the 
streaming `invoke_stream()` method. The agent returns assistant messages as a stream of incremental chunks. 
In addition, you can specify an `on_intermediate_message` callback to receive fully-formed tool-related 
messages — such as function calls and their results — while the assistant response is still being streamed.

In this example, the agent is configured with a plugin that provides menu specials and item pricing.
As the user interacts with the agent, tool messages (like function calls) are emitted via the callback,
while assistant replies stream back incrementally through the main response loop.
