The following sample demonstrates how to create an OpenAI
assistant using either Azure OpenAI or OpenAI. OpenAI Assistants
allow for function calling, the use of file search and a
code interpreter. Assistant Threads are used to manage the
conversation state, similar to a Semantic Kernel Chat History.
This sample also demonstrates the Assistants Streaming
capability and how to manage an Assistants chat history.
