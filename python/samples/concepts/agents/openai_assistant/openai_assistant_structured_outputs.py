"""
The following sample demonstrates how to create an OpenAI
assistant using either Azure OpenAI or OpenAI and leverage the
assistant's ability to returned structured outputs, based on a user-defined
Pydantic model. This could also be a non-Pydantic model. Use the convenience
method on the OpenAIAssistantAgent class to configure the response format,
as shown below.

Note, you may specify your own JSON Schema. You'll need to make sure it is correct
if not using the convenience method, per the following format:

json_schema = {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": {
        "schema": {
            "properties": {
                "response": {"title": "Response", "type": "string"},
                "items": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Items", "type": "array"},
            },
            "required": ["response", "items"],
            "title": "ResponseModel",
            "type": "object",
            "additionalProperties": False,
        },
        "name": "ResponseModel",
        "strict": True,
    },
}

# Create the assistant definition
definition = await client.beta.assistants.create(
    model=model,
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant answering questions about the world in one sentence.",
    response_format=json_schema,
)

    items: list[str]
