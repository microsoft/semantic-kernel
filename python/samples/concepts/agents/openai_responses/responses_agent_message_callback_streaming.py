"""
The following sample demonstrates how to create an OpenAI
Responses Agent using either Azure OpenAI or OpenAI. The 
Responses Agent allow for function calling, the use of file search and a
web search tool. Responses Agent Threads are used to manage the
conversation state, similar to a Semantic Kernel Chat History.
Additionally, the invoke_stream configures a message callback 
to receive the conversation messages during streaming invocation.
This sample also demonstrates the Responses Agent Streaming
capability and how to manage a Responses Agent chat history.
