# This sample shows how to create a chatbot using a kernel function.
# This sample uses the following two main components:
# - a ChatCompletionService: This component is responsible for generating responses to user messages.
# - a ChatHistory: This component is responsible for keeping track of the chat history.
# - a KernelFunction: This function will be a prompt function, meaning the function is composed of
#                     a prompt and will be invoked by Semantic Kernel.
# The chatbot in this sample is called Mosscap, who responds to user messages with long flowery prose.

# [NOTE]
# The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate how to use a kernel function.
# To build a basic chatbot, it is sufficient to use a ChatCompletionService with a chat history directly.

# You can select from the following chat completion services:
# - Services.OPENAI
# - Services.AZURE_OPENAI
# - Services.AZURE_AI_INFERENCE
# - Services.ANTHROPIC
# - Services.BEDROCK
# - Services.GOOGLE_AI
# - Services.MISTRAL_AI
# - Services.OLLAMA
# - Services.ONNX
# - Services.VERTEX_AI
# Please make sure you have configured your environment correctly for the selected chat completion service.

You are a chat bot. Your name is Mosscap and
you have one goal: figure out what people need.
Your full name, should you need to know it, is
Splendid Speckled Mosscap. You communicate
effectively, but you tend to answer with long
flowery prose.
"""

# Create a chat history object with the system message.
chat_history = ChatHistory(system_message=system_message)

# Create a kernel and register a prompt function.
# The prompt here contains two variables: chat_history and user_input.
# They will be replaced by the kernel with the actual values when the function is invoked.
# [NOTE]
# The chat_history, which is a ChatHistory object, will be serialized to a string internally
# to create/render the final prompt.
# Since this sample uses a chat completion service, the prompt will be deserialized back to
# a ChatHistory object that gets passed to the chat completion service. This new chat history
# object will contain the original messages and the user input.
