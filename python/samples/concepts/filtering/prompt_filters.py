# A filter is a piece of custom code that runs at certain points in the process
# this sample has a filter that is called during Prompt Rendering.
# You can name the function itself with arbitrary names, but the signature needs to be:
# `context, next`
# You are then free to run code before the call to the next filter or the rendering itself.
# and code afterwards.
# this type of filter allows you to manipulate the final message being sent
# as is shown below, or the inputs used to generate the message by making a change to the
# arguments before calling next.
