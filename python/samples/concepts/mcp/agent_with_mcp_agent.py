"""
The following sample demonstrates how to create a chat completion agent that
answers questions about Github using a Semantic Kernel Plugin from a MCP server. 

It uses the Azure OpenAI service to create a agent, so make sure to 
set the required environment variables for the Azure AI Foundry service:
- AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
- Optionally: AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY 
If this is not set, it will try to use DefaultAzureCredential.
