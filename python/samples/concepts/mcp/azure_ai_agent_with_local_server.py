The following sample demonstrates how to create a chat completion agent that
answers questions about Github using a Local Agent with two local MCP Servers.

It uses the Azure AI Foundry Agent service to create a agent, so make sure to 
set the required environment variables for the Azure AI Foundry service:
- AZURE_AI_AGENT_PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING
- AZURE_AI_AGENT_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
