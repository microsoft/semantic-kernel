"""
This simple sample demonstrates how to use the OpenAI Realtime API to create
a agent that can listen and respond directly through audio.
It requires installing:
- semantic-kernel[realtime]
- pyaudio
- sounddevice
- pydub
e.g. pip install pyaudio sounddevice pydub semantic-kernel[realtime]

For more details of the exact setup, see the README.md in the realtime folder.
"""

# The characterics of your speaker and microphone are a big factor in a smooth conversation
# so you may need to try out different devices for each.
# you can also play around with the turn_detection settings to get the best results.
# It has device id's set in the AudioRecorderStream and AudioPlayerAsync classes,
# so you may need to adjust these for your system.
# you can disable the check for available devices by commenting the line below
