# Document Generator

This sample app demonstrates how to create technical documents for a codebase using AI. More specifically, it uses the agent framework offered by **Semantic Kernel** to ochestrate multiple agents to create a technical document.

This sample app also provides telemetry to monitor the agents, making it easier to observe the inner workings of the agents.

To learn more about agents, please refer to this introduction [video](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/generative-ai-for-beginners/ai-agents-generative-ai-for-beginners).
To learn more about the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework, please refer to the [Semantic Kernel documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/agent-architecture?pivots=programming-language-python).

> Note: This sample app cannot guarantee to generate a perfect technical document each time due to the stochastic nature of the AI model. Please a version of the document generated by the app in [GENERATED_DOCUMENT.md](GENERATED_DOCUMENT.md).

## Design

### Tools/PLugins

- **Code Execution Plugin**: This plugin offers a sandbox environment to execute Python snippets. It returns the output of the program or errors if any.
- **Repository File Plugin**: This plugin allows the AI to retrieve files from the Semantic Kernel repository.
- **User Input Plugin**: This plugin allows the AI to present content to the user and receive feedback.

### Agents

- **Content Creation Agent**: This agent is responsible for creating the content of the document. This agent has access to the **Repository File Plugin** to read source files it deems necessary for reference.
- **Code Validation Agent**: This agent is responsible for validating the code snippets in the document. This agent has access to the **Code Execution Plugin** to execute the code snippets.
- **User Agent**: This agent is responsible for interacting with the user. This agent has access to the **User Input Plugin** to present content to the user and receive feedback.

### Agent Selection Strategy

### Termination Strategy

## Prerequisites

1. Azure OpenAI
2. Azure Application Insights

## Additional packages

- `AICodeSandbox` - for executing AI generated code in a sandbox environment

    ```bash
    pip install ai-code-sandbox
    ```

    > You must also have `docker` installed and running on your machine. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/get-docker-desktop/) to install docker for your platform. Images will be pulled during runtime if not already present. Containers will be created and destroyed during code execution.

## Running the app

### Step 1: Set up the environment

Make sure you have the following environment variables set:

```env
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL_ID=<model-id>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

> gpt-4o-2024-08-06 was used to generate [GENERATED_DOCUMENT.md](GENERATED_DOCUMENT.md).
> Feel free to use other models from OpenAI or other providers. When you use models from another provider, make sure to update the chat completion services accordingly.

```env

### Step 2: Run the app

```bash
python ./main.py
```

Expected output:

```bash
==== ContentCreationAgent just responded ====
==== CodeValidationAgent just responded ====
==== ContentCreationAgent just responded ====
...
```

## Customization

Since this is a sample app that demonstrates the creation of a technical document on Semantic Kernel AI connectors, you can customize the app to suit your needs. You can try different tasks, add more agents, tune existing agents, change the agent selection strategy, or modify the termination strategy.

- To try a different task, modify the `TASK` prompt in `main.py`.
- To add more agents, create a new agent under `agents/` and add it to the `agents` list in `main.py`.
- To tune existing agents, modify the `INSTRUCTION` prompt in the agent's source code.
- To change the agent selection strategy, modify `custom_selection_strategy.py`.
- To change the termination strategy, modify `custom_termination_strategy.py`.

## Optional: Monitoring the agents

When you see the final document generated by the app, what you see is actually the creation of multiple agents working together. You may wonder, how did the agents work together to create the document? What was the sequence of actions taken by the agents? How did the agents interact with each other? To answer these questions, you need to **observe** the agents.

Semantic Kernel by default instruments all the LLM calls. However, for agents there is no default instrumentation. This sample app shows how one can extend the Semantic Kernel agent to add instrumentation.

> There are currently no standards on what information needs to be captured for agents as the concept of agents is still relatively new. At the time of writing, the Semantic Convention for agents is still in the draft stage: <https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/issues/1732>

To monitor the agents, set the following environment variables:

```env
AZURE_APP_INSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING=<your-connection-string>

SEMANTICKERNEL_EXPERIMENTAL_GENAI_ENABLE_OTEL_DIAGNOSTICS=true
SEMANTICKERNEL_EXPERIMENTAL_GENAI_ENABLE_OTEL_DIAGNOSTICS_SENSITIVE=true
```
