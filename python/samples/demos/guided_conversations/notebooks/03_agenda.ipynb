    "# The Guided Conversation Agenda\n",

    "Another core module or plugin of the GuidedConversation is the Agenda. This is a specialized Pydantic BaseModel that gives the agent the ability to explicitly reason about a longer term plan, or agenda, for the conversation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The BaseModel consists of a list of items, each with a description (a string) and a number of turns (an integer). It will raise an error if an input violates the type requirements. This check is particularly important for turn allocations. For example, sometimes a conversation agent provides fractional estimates (\"0.6 turns\") or broad ranges (\"5-20\" turns), both of which are meaningless. We also added additional validations which raise an error if the total number of turns allocated across items is invalid (e.g., it exceeds the number of remaining turns) depending on the resource constraint. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an error is raised, the agent is raised, the agent is prompted to revise the agenda. To prevent infinite loops, we imposed a limit on the number of retries."

    "For this notebook we will revisit the teaching example from the first notebook. In that demo, under the hood the agent was actually making mistakes in its allocation of turns, mostly in generating an invalid number of cumulative turns. However, thanks to the Agenda plugin, it was able to automatically detect and correct these mistakes before they snowballed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by setting up the Agenda plugin. It takes in a resource constraint type, which as a reminder controls conversation length. Currently it can be either *maximum*  to set an upper limit and an *exact* mode for precise conversation lengths. Depending on the selected mode, the validation will differ. For example, for exact mode the total number of turns allocated across items must be exactly equal to the total number of turns available. While in maximum mode, the total number of turns allocated across items must be less than or equal to the total number of turns available."
