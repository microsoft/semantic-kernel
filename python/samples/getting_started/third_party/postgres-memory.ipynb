      "1. **Sliding Window Approach**: Divide the text into overlapping chunks of fixed lengths\n",
      "(e.g., 512 tokens with an overlap of 128 tokens). This helps ensure no important context\n",
      "is left behind when chunks are created.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Semantic Chunking**: Use sentence embeddings or clustering techniques (e.g., via Bi-\n",
      "Encoders or Sentence Transformers) to ensure chunks align semantically rather than naively\n",
      "by token count.\n",
      "3. **Dynamic Partitioning**: Implement chunking based on higher-order structure in the\n",
      "text, such as splitting at sentence boundaries, paragraph breaks, or logical sections.\n",
      "4. **Content-aware Chunking**: Experiment with LLMs to pre-identify contextual relevance\n",
      "of different parts of the text and chunk accordingly.\n",
