Create a new file named `.env` and place it in this directory. Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file from this directory and paste it into the `.env` file that you just created.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: using Azure OpenAI\n",

    "Add your [Azure Open AI Service key](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quickstart?pivots=programming-language-studio) settings to the `.env` file in the same folder:\n",

    "You can run Weaviate in 5 ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SaaS** – with [Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS)](https://weaviate.io/pricing).\n",
    "\n",
    "  WCS is a fully managed service that takes care of hosting, scaling, and updating your Weaviate instance. You can try it out for free with a sandbox that lasts for 14 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To set up a SaaS Weaviate instance with WCS:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1.  Navigate to [Weaviate Cloud Console](https://console.weaviate.cloud/).\n",
    "  2.  Register or sign in to your WCS account.\n",
    "  3.  Create a new cluster with the following settings:\n",
    "      - `Subscription Tier` – Free sandbox for a free trial, or contact [hello@weaviate.io](mailto:hello@weaviate.io) for other options.\n",
    "      - `Cluster name` – a unique name for your cluster. The name will become part of the URL used to access this instance.\n",
    "      - `Enable Authentication?` – Enabled by default. This will generate a static API key that you can use to authenticate.\n",
    "  4.  Wait for a few minutes until your cluster is ready. You will see a green tick ✔️ when it's done. Copy your cluster URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hybrid SaaS**\n",
    "\n",
    "  > If you need to keep your data on-premise for security or compliance reasons, Weaviate also offers a Hybrid SaaS option: Weaviate runs within your cloud instances, but the cluster is managed remotely by Weaviate. This gives you the benefits of a managed service without sending data to an external party.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The Weaviate Hybrid SaaS is a custom solution. If you are interested in this option, please reach out to [hello@weaviate.io](mailto:hello@weaviate.io).\n",

    "\n",
    "  1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your local machine if it is not already installed.\n",
    "  2. [Install the Docker Compose Plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)\n",
    "  3. Download a `docker-compose.yml` file with this `curl` command:\n",

    "     Alternatively, you can use Weaviate's docker compose [configuration tool](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose) to generate your own `docker-compose.yml` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Run `docker compose up -d` to spin up a Weaviate instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "     > To shut it down, run `docker compose down`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-hosted** – with a Kubernetes cluster\n",
