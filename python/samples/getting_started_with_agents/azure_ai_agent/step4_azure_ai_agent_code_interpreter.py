        The dataset has been successfully loaded and contains information regarding sales, profits, and related metrics 
        for various segments. To calculate the total sales across all segments, we can use the "Sales" column.

        Here's the code to calculate the total sales:

        ```python
        # Calculate the total sales for all segments
        total_sales = data['Sales'].sum()

        total_sales
        ```
