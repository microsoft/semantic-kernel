"""
The following sample demonstrates how to create a chat completion agent that
answers user questions using structured outputs. The `Reasoning` model is defined
on the prompt execution settings. The settings are then passed into the agent
via the `KernelArguments` object.

The interaction with the agent is via the `get_response` method, which sends a
user input to the agent and receives a response from the agent. The conversation
history needs to be maintained by the caller in the chat history object.
