"""
The following sample demonstrates how to create a group chat orchestration with human
in the loop. Human in the loop is achieved by overriding the default round robin manager
to allow user input after the reviewer agent's message.

Think of the group chat manager as a state machine, with the following possible states:
- Request for user message
- Termination, after which the manager will try to filter a result from the conversation
- Continuation, at which the manager will select the next agent to speak

This sample demonstrates the basic steps of customizing the group chat manager to enter
the user input state, creating a human response function to get user input, and providing
it to the group chat manager.

There are two agents in this orchestration: a writer and a reviewer. They work iteratively
to refine a slogan for a new electric SUV.
