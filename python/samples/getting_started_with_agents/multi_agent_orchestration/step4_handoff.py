"""
The following sample demonstrates how to create a handoff orchestration that represents
a customer support triage system. The orchestration consists of 4 agents, each specialized
in a different area of customer support: triage, refunds, order status, and order returns.

Depending on the customer's request, agents can hand off the conversation to the appropriate
agent.

Human in the loop is achieved via a callback function similar to the one used in group chat
orchestration. Except that in the handoff orchestration, all agents have access to the
human response function, whereas in the group chat orchestration, only the manager has access
to the human response function.

This sample demonstrates the basic steps of creating and starting a runtime, creating
a handoff orchestration, invoking the orchestration, and finally waiting for the results.
