"""
The following sample demonstrates how to create a handoff orchestration that can triage
GitHub issues based on their content. The orchestration consists of 3 agents, each
specialized in a different area.

The input to the orchestration is not longer a string or a chat message, but a Pydantic
model (i.e. structure input). The model will get transformed into a chat message before
being passed to the agents. This allows the orchestration to become more flexible and
easier reusable.

This sample demonstrates the basic steps of creating and starting a runtime, creating
a handoff orchestration, invoking the orchestration, and finally waiting for the results.
