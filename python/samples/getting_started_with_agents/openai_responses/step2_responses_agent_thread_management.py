"""
The following sample demonstrates how to create an OpenAI Responses Agent.
The sample shows how to have the assistant answer questions about the world.

The interaction with the agent is via the `get_response` method, which sends a
user input to the agent and receives a response from the agent. The conversation
history is maintained by the agent service, i.e. the responses are automatically
associated with the thread. Therefore, client code does not need to maintain the
conversation history.

    # created and returned with the initial response

    You should see output similar to the following:

    # Joker: Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts!
    # User: 'Explain why this is funny.'
    # Joker: The joke is funny because it plays on the double meaning of "guts"â€”literally referring to internal organs, 
        which skeletons lack, and metaphorically meaning courage.
    # User: 'What have we been talking about?'
    # Joker: We've been discussing a skeleton joke and why it's funny.
