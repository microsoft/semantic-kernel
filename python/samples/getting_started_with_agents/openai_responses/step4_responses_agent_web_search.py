"""
The following sample demonstrates how to create an OpenAI Responses Agent.
The sample shows how to have the agent answer questions using the web search
preview tool with streaming responses.

The interaction with the agent is via the `get_response` method, which sends a
user input to the agent and receives a response from the agent. The conversation
history is maintained by the agent service, i.e. the responses are automatically
associated with the thread. Therefore, client code does not need to maintain the
conversation history.

    "Find me news articles about the latest technology trends.",

    # 1. Create the client using OpenAI resources and configuration
    # Note: the Azure OpenAI Responses API does not yet support the web search tool.
    client, model = OpenAIResponsesAgent.setup_resources()

    web_search_tool = OpenAIResponsesAgent.configure_web_search_tool()

    # 2. Create a Semantic Kernel agent for the OpenAI Responses API

        name="NewsSearcher",
        tools=[web_search_tool],

    # 3. Create a thread for the agent
    # If no thread is provided, a new thread will be
    # created and returned with the initial response
    thread = None
