    Most vectors stores use a `list[float]` as the data type for vectors.
    This is the default and all vector stores in SK use this internally.
    But in your class you may want to use a numpy array or some other optimized type,
    in order to support that,
    you can set the deserialize_function to a function that takes a list of floats and returns the optimized type,
    and then also supply a serialize_function that takes the optimized type and returns a list of floats.

    For instance for numpy, that would be `serialize_function=np.ndarray.tolist` and `deserialize_function=np.array`,
    (with `import numpy as np` at the top of your file).
    if you want to set it up with more specific options, use a lambda, a custom function or a partial.

    Args:
        property_type (str, optional): Property type.
            For vectors this should be the inner type of the vector.
            By default the vector will be a list of numbers.
            If you want to use a numpy array or some other optimized format,
            set the cast_function with a function
            that takes a list of floats and returns a numpy array.
        local_embedding (bool, optional): Whether to embed the vector locally. Defaults to True.
        embedding_settings (dict[str, PromptExecutionSettings], optional): Embedding settings.
            The key is the name of the embedding service to use, can be multiple ones.
        serialize_function (Callable[[Any], list[float | int]], optional): Serialize function,
            should take the vector and return a list of numbers.
        deserialize_function (Callable[[list[float | int]], Any], optional): Deserialize function,
            should take a list of numbers and return the vector.
