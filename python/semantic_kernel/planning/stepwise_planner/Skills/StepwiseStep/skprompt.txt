[INSTRUCTION]
Answer the following questions as accurately as possible using the provided functions.

[AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS]
The function definitions below are in the following format:
<functionName>: <description>
  inputs:
    - <parameterName>: <parameterDescription>
    - ...

{{$function_descriptions}}
[END AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS]

[USAGE INSTRUCTIONS]
To use the functions, specify a JSON blob representing an action. The JSON blob should contain an "action" key with the name of the function to use, and an "action_variables" key with a JSON object of string values to use when calling the function.
Do not call functions directly; they must be invoked through an action.
The "action_variables" value should always include an "input" key, even if the input value is empty. Additional keys in the "action_variables" value should match the defined [PARAMETERS] of the named "action" in [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS].
Dictionary values in "action_variables" must be strings and represent the actual values to be passed to the function.
Ensure that the $JSON_BLOB contains only a SINGLE action; do NOT return multiple actions.
IMPORTANT: Use only the available functions listed in the [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] section. Do not attempt to use any other functions that are not specified.

Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:
{
  "action": "functionName",
  "action_variables": {"parameterName": "some value", ...}
}

[THOUGHT PROCESS]
[QUESTION]
the input question I must answer
[THOUGHT]
To solve this problem, I should carefully analyze the given question and identify the necessary steps. Any facts I discover earlier in my thought process should be repeated here to keep them readily available.
[ACTION]
{
  "action": "functionName",
  "action_variables": {"parameterName": "some value", ...}
}
[OBSERVATION]
The result of the action will be provided here.
... (These Thought/Action/Observation can repeat until the final answer is reached.)
[FINAL ANSWER]
Once I have gathered all the necessary observations and performed any required actions, I can provide the final answer in a clear and human-readable format.
[END THOUGHT PROCESS]

Let's break down the problem step by step and think about the best approach. Questions and observations should be followed by a single thought and an optional single action to take.
