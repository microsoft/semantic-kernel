// Consider populating secrets, such as "Key" and "ConnectionString" properties, using dotnet's user-secrets command when running locally.

{
  //
  // Service configuration
  // - Optionally set SemanticSkillsDirectory to the directory from which to load semantic skills (e.g., "./SemanticSkills").
  // - Optionally set KeyVaultUri to the URI of the Key Vault for secrets (e.g., "https://contoso.vault.azure.net/").

  // Default AI service configuration for generating AI responses and embeddings from the user's input.
  // https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat
  // To use Azure OpenAI as the AI completion service:
  // - Set "Type" to "AzureOpenAI" 
  // - Set "Endpoint" to the endpoint of your Azure OpenAI instance (e.g., "https://contoso.openai.azure.com")
  // - Set "Key" using dotnet's user secrets (see above)
  //     (i.e. dotnet user-secrets set "AIService:Key" "MY_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY")
  //
  // To use OpenAI as the AI completion service:
  // - Set "Type" to "OpenAI"
  // - Set "Key" using dotnet's user secrets (see above)
  //     (i.e. dotnet user-secrets set "AIService:Key" "MY_OPENAI_KEY")
  //
  // - Set Completion and Planner models to a chat completion model (e.g., gpt-35-turbo, gpt-4).
  // - Set the Embedding model to an embedding model (e.g., "text-embedding-ada-002").
  //

  },
  //
  // Planner can determine which skill functions, if any, need to be used to fulfill a user's request.
  // https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts-sk/planner
  // - Set Planner:Type to "Action" to use the single-step ActionPlanner (default)
  // - Set Planner:Type to "Sequential" to enable the multi-step SequentialPlanner
  //   See the "Enabling Sequential Planner" section in webapi/README.md for configuration instructions.
  //
  "Planner": {
    "Type": "Action"
  },
  //
  // Optional Azure Speech service configuration for providing Azure Speech access tokens.
  // - Set the Region to the region of your Azure Speech resource (e.g., "westus").
  // - Set the Key using dotnet's user secrets (see above)

  // Chat stores are used for storing chat sessions and messages.
  // - Supported Types are "volatile", "filesystem", or "cosmos".

  // Memory stores are used for storing new memories and retrieving semantically similar memories.
  // - Supported Types are "volatile", "qdrant", or "azurecognitivesearch".
  // - When using Qdrant or Azure Cognitive Search, see ./README.md for deployment instructions.
  // - If Azure Cognitive Search is selected AND UseVectorSearch is set to false, you will be
  //   using ACS's semantic search (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/semantic-search-overview)
  //   instead of its vector search feature (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-overview)
  //   This means that:
  //     * The "Semantic Search" feature must be enabled on Azure Cognitive Search.
  //     * The Embedding configuration above will not be used.
  // - Set "MemoriesStore:AzureCognitiveSearch:Key" using dotnet's user secrets (see above)
  //     (i.e. dotnet user-secrets set "MemoriesStore:AzureCognitiveSearch:Key" "MY_AZCOGSRCH_KEY")
  // - Set "MemoriesStore:Qdrant:Key" using dotnet's user secrets (see above) if you are using a Qdrant Cloud instance.

  // - Default token limits are suggested by OpenAI:
  // https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them
  // - Prevent large uploads by setting a file size limit (in bytes) as suggested here:
